         DESCRIPTION OF OUTPUT FROM THE FITTING PROGRAM

         LDHFIT.COM (C-LANGUAGE)

        A. RESULTS

         At various stages of the fitting, determined by the control
        values prt_cycle and quad_test, the computer program displays on
        the crt terminal and stores on disk the parameter and data arrays
        and other results.

         The interpretation of this output is explained here.  The
        description is for the output from LDHFIT, but it holds, except
        for some special values given at the end of the data display, for
        any function fit by use of the SIMPxxxx routines.

         (1) SIMPLEX: for each vertex of the simplex, the function value
        is displayed, then two lines of values (four values per line)
        give in order the values of the 7 parameters. Note that
        parameters (1) through (6) are different for each vertex, ie they
        are free to be optimized, and that parameter (7) is fixed at the
        small value 1E-10. The number of vertices is one greater than the
        number of free parameters ( 6 + 1 = 7 ).

         NOTE: in some of the displays, the count of vertices or
        parameters starts at 0. For example, in the above display of the
        simplex, the first vertex is vertex(0) and the 7th is vertex(6).

         (2) CENTROID OF THE SIMPLEX: the function value is given, then
        two lines of values (four values per line) give in order the
        values of the 7 parameters. The centroid is the average of the
        vertices of the simplex and is the preferred set of estimates of
        the best-fit parameter values. These estimates are used in the
        calculation of YCALC, of the points for construction of
        reciprocal plots, and of the values of the kinetic constants,
        given later in the output.

         (3) EXIT TESTING: immediately following the centroid listing,
        one line gives the mean of the function values, the root mean
        square deviation of the function values from the mean, and the
        test value = rms deviation/mean. When the test value is less than
        the control value exit_test, generally set at 0.00000001, the
        fitting is completed.

         (4) RMS ERROR: the root mean square error of the fit is the
        square root of the quantity: the least squares function value at
        the centroid divided by the number of data points less the number
        of free parameters ( RMS ERROR = SQRT(CENTROID SSQ/(# DATA - #
        FREE PARAMETERS). The rms error is useful as a test for the
        quality of the fit (ie, of the deviations between observed and
        calculated values). The rms error should be no greater than the


                                        1









        average expected uncertainty in the data. If it is greater than
        expectation, the fit may be unsatisfactory. The rms error can
        also be used as a test for flyers among the data points. A
        deviation of 3 x rms error between the observed and calculated
        values is sufficient to allow dropping of a data point from the
        fitting, or to cause you to check your calculation of vo.

         (5) DATA AND CALCULATED VALUES: for each data point are listed
        in order the values of: Yobserved(i), which is the initial
        reaction rate you measured and entered into the program as data;
        Ycalculated(i) = Ymodel(i), which is the initial reaction rate
        calculated with the model equation and the best-fit parameter
        values of the centroid; Yobserved(i) - Ycalculated(i), which is
        the deviation between observation and calculation; the
        statistical weight of the data point, here set at unity; and the
        values of the independent variables for the data point, which are
        in order the concentrations of NADH, pyruvate, and lactate (a, b,
        and p).

         (6) VALUES CALCULATED FROM THE BEST-FIT PARAMETERS: following
        the display of the data, various other values are displayed: (a)
        the coordinates of points that can be used to draw the lines of
        the primary and secondary reciprocal plots used in steady-state
        kinetic analysis; (b) values of the parameters, a variation of
        the listing under CENTROID.

         (7) QUADRATIC FIT: at intervals determined by the control value
        quad_test, quadratic fitting of the function surface is carried
        out, to reconstruct the simplex and to obtain standard deviations
        of the free parameters. There is considerable screen display that
        allows tracking of the process. The handout "Notes on the fitting
        program", subsection on standard deviations, serves as an
        explanation of this output. The information you are likely to be
        most interested in is the last group of values, under "STANDARD
        DEVIATIONS OF THE FREE PARAMETERS." Look especially for failure
        of the quadratic fit to give proper standard deviations. If the
        quadratic fit fails, the values of the Q MATRIX DIAGONAL and of
        the B MATRIX DIAGONAL can be helpful in deciding what to do, eg.
        whether to fix a parameter.

         (8) STANDARD DEVIATIONS FOR THE FREE PARAMETERS: after
        completion of the quadratic fit, a table is displayed which
        includes estimates of the standard deviations of the free
        parameters. Following this table, the vertices of the
        reconstructed simplex are given. Further minimization starts with
        this simplex. If y-pmin is less than yzero = ycentroid, the
        parameter values at pmin, an improved estimate, are inserted as
        one of the vertices of the reconstructed simplex. This procedure
        can speed up convergence.

        B. MINIMIZATION

         There is output during minimization. In each cycle of the
        Nelder-Mead simplex method, the vertex with the highest least
        squares function value is adjusted to give a lower value. The
        output displayed at each cycle allows one to track this process.

         (1) One line giving in order: the number of the cycle, the
        values of the least squares function before adjustment and after
        adjustment, and the adjustment operation.

         (2) One or more lines giving the parameter values of the vertex
        before adjustment.

         (3) One or more lines giving the parameter values after
        adjustment.

         (4) One or more lines giving the parameter values of the
        centroid of the simplex.

         (5) One line giving the mean and rms deviation of the function
        values of all the vertices of the simplex after the adjustment,
        and the test value rms deviation/mean.

         (6) One line giving the rms error of the current best fit to the
        data.

         (7) One line describing results of the last quadratic fit.
