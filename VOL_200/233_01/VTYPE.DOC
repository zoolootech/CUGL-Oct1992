| * VTYPE * An improved TYPE command for the IBM PC & PC-XT. V. Bly 12/12/83 |

SUMMARY
-------
      VTYPE is an improved version of the MS-DOS TYPE command.  It provides
  the new features listed below.
     1 ... The ability to quickly pause the display by pressing a key.
	   The display may be restarted by pressing a key again.
     2 ... The ability to cancel the displayed output at the end of the
	   current line by pressing the [Esc] key.
     3 ... The ability to specify the number of spaces per tab in the
	   displayed output by following the filespec by a number between
	   1 and 20.  If you do not specify a number, the default value
	   of 8 spaces per tab stop will be used.
     4 ... The ability, when using MS-DOS 2.0, of copying a text file
	   containing tabs to a new file with all tabs expanded to spaces.

      The format for the VTYPE command is:
					   VTYPE filespec [tab expansion]

EXAMPLES
--------
      The following examples assume that the file VTYPE.EXE is on the
  default disk drive.  Note that "<enter>" means that you should press
  the enter/return key after typing the command.

  VTYPE MY.TXT <enter>
	This command will simply display the text file "MY.TXT".  You can
	pause the output by pressing a key (such as the <space> bar).  You
	can then restart the display by pressing a key (such as the <space>
	bar) again, or cancel the output by pressing the [Esc] key.

  VTYPE MYPROG.C 4 <enter>
	This command will display the text file "MYPROG.C".  However, any
	tabs in the file will be expanded to 4 spaces per tab stop rather
	than the normal 8 spaces per tab.

  VTYPE MYPROGA.C 6>MYPROGB.C <enter>
	This command will copy the text file "MYPROGA.C" to the new file
	"MYPROGB.C".  Any tabs in the file "MYPROGA.C" will be expanded
	to 6 spaces per tab stop in the new file "MYPROGB.C".  Of course,
	this command can only be used with MS-DOS 2.0 or later, since it
	uses redirection.

NOTES
-----
      When redirecting the output of VTYPE to a disk file under MS-DOS 2.0,
 the End-OF-File termination will be slightly different than normal.  This
 will not usually be a problem; however, some text handling programs, such
 as the VEDIT editor, may display a string of "^@"s at the end of the file.
 If you encounter this, simply delete the string of "^@"s and re-save the
 file.
