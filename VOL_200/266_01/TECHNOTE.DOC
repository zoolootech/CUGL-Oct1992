           What's New in micro PLOX            TECHNOTE.DOC
                 July 1990

Release 5.0 includes both some restructuring and new features.

The new features are:

  (1) Multi color plots for color monitors.

  (2) A settable margin for the picture so that multiple small pictures
      can be put on a page or pictures mixed with text.

  (3) The PLOX statement-type keyword (first word on a line) may be
      lower or upper case.

  (4) There is a pause after every error message.

  (5) The data file to be used may be given at run time.

  (6) Some PLOX commands may be put in the data file.  When combined
      with (5) above this allows a single picture description to
      produce any number of similar looking charts each using
      different data.

The restructuring includes:

  (1) All modules compiled with Watcom 7.0.

  (2) The front end portability problem is solved by using four
      simple variables global to the CONLIB file only.

  (3) Header files with ANSI prototypes are provided for all
      libraries.

  (4) The back end was totally restructured to eliminate duplicate
      code and the monitor drivers now write directly to the screen.
      There are 2 main drivers, one for printers, one for screens.
      These drivers are #included into the various main program
      shells (like PLOTEPS) which define their customizing macros.
