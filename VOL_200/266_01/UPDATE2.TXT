                       Micro PLOX                        UPDATE2.TXT
                        July 1990

With Release 5.0 the portabitlity problems in the front end routine, PLOX,
have been solved by a different method than that reported in UPDATE.TXT.

The scaling and sizing values that were passed among some of the xxCON
functions are now global to CONLIB.C where all the functions resided
anyway.  This is standard C with no pointer puns and should be
absolutely portable.

The UPDATE.TXT comments on interfacing shared printers under XENIX are
still valid and should be very helpful to XENIX users.
