NAME
     comm - select or reject lines common to two sorted files

SYNTAX
     comm [ - [ 123 ] ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     Comm reads file1 and file2, which should be sorted, and produces
     a three column output: lines only in file1; lines only in file2; 
     and lines in both files.  The filename '-' means the standard input.

     Flags 1, 2, or 3 suppress printing of the corresponding
     column.  Thus comm -12 prints only the lines common to the
     two files; comm -23 prints only lines in the first file but
     not in the second; comm -123 is a no-op.
