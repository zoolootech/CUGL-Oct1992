NAME
     tr - translate characters

SYNTAX
     tr [ -cds ] string1 [ string2 ]

DESCRIPTION
    Tr copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution or 
    deletion of selected characters.  Input characters found in string1 are 
    mapped into the corresponding characters of string2.  When string2 is short
    it is padded to the length of string1 by duplicating its last character.  
    
    Any combination of the options -cds may be used: 
    
    -c  complements the set of characters in string1 with respect to the 
	universe of characters whose ASCII codes are 01 through 0377 octal
    
    -d  deletes all input characters in string1
    
    -s  squeezes all strings of repeated output characters that are in 
	string2 to single characters.

    In either string the notation a-b means a range of characters from a to b 
    in increasing ASCII order.  The character '\' followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal 
    digits stands for the character whose ASCII code is given by those digits.
    A '\' followed by b, n, r, f, t, s stand for the ASCII character BS, LF,
    CR, HT, SP.  A '\' followed by any other character stands for that 
    character.

EXAMPLE
    The following example creates a list of all the words in 'file1' one per 
    line in 'file2', where a word is taken to be a string of alphabetics.  

          tr -cs A-Za-z \n <file1 >file2

RESTRICTIONS
     Tr deletes all ASCII NUL characters from the input.  A '\000' specified 
     in string1 or string2 is translated to mean '\001'.
