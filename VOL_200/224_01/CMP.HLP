NAME
     cmp - compare two files

SYNTAX
     cmp [ -l ] [ -s ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     The two files are compared.  (If file1 is '-', the standard
     input is used.) Under default options, cmp makes no comment
     if the files are the same.  If they differ, it announces the
     byte and line number at which the difference occurred.  If
     one file is an initial subsequence of the other, that fact
     is noted.

     Options:

     -l    Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing
           bytes (octal) for each difference.

     -s    Print nothing for differing files; return codes only.

SEE ALSO
     diff, comm

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for different
     files, and 2 for an inaccessible or missing argument.

RESTRICTIONS
     Only one option may be specified at a time.
