NAME
     od - octal, decimal, hex, ascii, or floating point dump

SYNTAX
     od [ -format ] [-bnnn] [-ennn] [ file_list ]

DESCRIPTION
     Od displays the files in the file_list, or the standard input if a
     file_list missing, in one or more dump formats as selected by the
     format argument.  The default format is "-sx".

     The meanings of the format argument characters are:

     c    Dump as ascii characters.  Tabs, backspaces, carriage returns, 
          form feeds, and line feeds are displayed as \t, \b, \r, \f, and \n.
          All other non-printing characters are displayed as a hexadecimal
          byte.

     d    Dump as signed decimal words ( 2 bytes ).

     u    Dump as unsigned decimal words.

     o    Dump as unsigned octal words.

     x    Dump as unsigned hexadecimal words.

     f    Dump as a floating point number ( 4 bytes ).

     l    Extend precision to long size (i.e. words to long words (4 bytes)
          and floating point to double precision (8 bytes).)  This does not
          affect the "c" format.

     s    Lower precision to short size.  This is only valid for integer words
          which are reduced to a byte size.


     The offset options are:

     -b   The beginning offset argument specifies the byte offset into the 
          file where dumping is to commence.  The offset is a decimal number.

     -e   The ending offset argument specifies the byte offset into the file
          where dumping will cease.  The offset must be a decimal number.

     The displayed address is a long word in hexadecimal format.

EXAMPLE:
     Display the first 100 bytes of a.out in long octal format.

	od -lo -e100 a.out
