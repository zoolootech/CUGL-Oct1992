NAME
     ls - list contents of directory

SYNTAX
     ls [ -adflrst ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
     For each directory argument, ls lists the contents of the
     directory; for each file argument, ls repeats its name and
     any other information requested.  By default, the output is
     sorted alphabetically.  When no argument is given, the
     current directory is listed.

     The options are:

     -l   List in long format, giving file type (see below), size in bytes, 
          and time of last modification for each file. 

     -t   Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of by
          name.

     -a   List all entries.  Use this option to see read-only, hidden, and
          system files.  This option also will print any files that begin
          with a period (.).

     -s   Give size in bytes of each file.

     -d   If argument is a directory, list only its name; often
          used with -l to get the status of a directory.

     -r   Reverse the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic or
          oldest first as appropriate.

     -f   Force each argument to be interpreted as a directory
          and list the name found in each slot.  This option
          turns off -l, -t, -s, and -r, and turns on -a; the
          order is the order in which entries appear in the
          directory.

     The mode printed under the -l option contains 4 characters
     which are interpreted as follows: 

     R  if the entry is a read-only file;
     H  if the entry is a hidden file;
     S  if the entry is a system file;
     D  if the entry is a directory;
     -  if the entry is not one of the above types.

     When the size of the file is listed, a total count of directories, 
     files, and bytes are printed at the end of the list.
