NAME
     pr - print file

SYNTAX
     pr [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Pr produces a printed listing of one or more files. The output is 
     separated into pages headed by a date, the name of the file or 
     a specified header, and the page number.  If there are no file arguments,
     pr prints the standard input.  Pr outputs to the standard output, so
     redirection to the printer is accomplished by including ">prn:" on the
     command line.

     Options apply to all following files but may be reset between files:

     -h   Take the next argument as a page header.

     -f   Take the next argument as a page footer.

     -ln  Take the length of the page to be n lines instead of the default 66.
          As the minimum page length is 12 lines, n must be greater than 12.

     -wn  Take the width of the page to be n columns instead of the default 96.
          The minumum width is 24 columns.

     -d   Include the date in the page header.

     -n   Number the pages.

     -r   Reset all the options to the default options.

     -s   Standard options: Filename, date and page number as the header.
