NAME
     cat - concatenate and print

SYNTAX
     cat [-b] [-e] [-n] [-s] [-t] [-v]  file...

DESCRIPTION
     Cat reads each file in sequence and displays it on the standard output.
     Thus
                    cat file

     displays the file on the standard output, and

                    cat file1 file2 >file3

     concatenates the first two files and places the result on the third.

     If no input file is given, or if the argument '-' is encountered, 
     cat reads from the standard input file.  Output is line buffered.

     The -b option ignores blank lines and precedes all other output with 
     line numbers.

     The -e option displays a dollar sign ($) at the end of each output line.

     The -n option precedes all output lines (including blank lines) with 
     line numbers.

     The -s option squeezes adjacent empty lines so that the output is 
     displayed single spaced.

     The -t option displays all non-printing characters including tabs in the 
     output.  In addition to those representations used with the -v option, 
     all tab characters are displayed as ^I.

     The -v option displays non-printing characters (except tabs).  
     <CTRL/x> (control character x) prints as ^X.  The delete character 
     (octal 0177) prints as ^?.  Non-ascii characters (with the high bit set) 
     are printed as M- (for meta) followed by the character of the low 7 bits.

RESTRICTIONS
     Beware of 'cat a b >a' and 'cat a b >b', which destroy the input files 
     before reading them.
