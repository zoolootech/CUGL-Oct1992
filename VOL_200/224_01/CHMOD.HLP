NAME
    chmod - change file attributes

SYNTAX
    chmod [+r -r] [+h -h] [+s -s] [+a -a]  file_list

DESCRIPTION
    Chmod can modify the file attributes, read-only (r), hidden (h),  
    system (s), and archive (a).  The '+' preceeding the attribute letter  
    will set that attribute on, the '-' will set the attribute off.  The
    '-' option has higher precedence than the '+' option.  Chmod will print 
    the file's current attribute to the standard output.

    The read-only attribute will protect the file from being written to or 
    deleted, but the file will be seen in the directory listings. The hidden 
    and the system attributes hide the file from normal directory listings.
    The archive attribute is set whenever the file has been written to and
    closed.  The hidden and system files will be listed if the -a option is 
    used with the UTILIX ls command.
