NAME
     uniq - report repeated lines in a file

SYNTAX
     uniq [-udc] [+ n] [- n] [ input [ output ] ]

DESCRIPTION
    Uniq reads the input file comparing adjacent lines.  In the normal case, 
    the second and succeeding copies of repeated lines are removed; the 
    remainder is written on the output file.  Note that repeated lines must be
    adjacent in order to be found.  
    
    The options are:
	
    -u  Just the lines that are not repeated in the original file are output.
	
    -d  Just the one copy of the repeated lines is output.  
	
    -c  Generates an output in default style (-u and -d selected) but with 
	each line preceded by a count of the number of times it occurred.

    -n  The first n fields together with any blanks before each are ignored.  
	A field is defined as a string of non-space, non-tab characters 
	separated by tabs and spaces from its neighbors.

    +n  The first n characters are ignored.  Fields are skipped before 
	characters.

    The default option is the union of the -u and -d options (each unique
    line is output).  The -c option supersedes -u and -d options.
   
    The n for the field and character count has to be a separate argument.
