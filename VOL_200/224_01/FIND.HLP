NAME
     find - find files

SYNTAX
     find  pathname-list  expressions

DESCRIPTION
    Find recursively descends the directory hierarchy for each pathname in 
    the pathname-list (i.e., one or more pathnames) seeking files that match 
    a boolean expression written in the primaries given below.  The option 
    names have to have lower case letters.

     -name filename
		True if the filename argument matches the current file name.  
		Enclose the filename with single quotes if wildcards for 
		filenames are used.

     -time n    True if the file has been modified in n days.  The -name option
		has to be used in conjunction with the -time option.
                The argument n is a decimal integer where 
		    +n means more than n, 
		    -n means less than n and 
		     n means exactly n.

     -newer file
		True if the current file has been modified more recently than 
		the argument file.  The -name option has to be used in 
		conjunction with the -newer option.

     -exec command
		True if the executed command returns a zero value as exit
                status.  The end of the command must have a semicolon.  
                A command argument '{}' is replaced by the current pathname.
		If the -name option is used, '{}' is replaced by the current
		filename with its full path.

     -ok command
		Like -exec except that the generated command is written on the 
		standard output, then the standard input is read and the 
		command is executed only upon response 'y' or 'Y'.

     -print     Always true; causes the current pathname to be printed.  If
		the -name option is used, the current filename with its full 
		path is printed.
		
     -dir       Always true; cause the current pathname (or filename) to be 
		printed in a long directory format.

    -all        All types of files including directories will be sought. 
                This is normally used with the "-name" option.

EXAMPLE
     To remove all files named '*.o' that have not been modified for a week:

	find \ -name '*.o' -time +7 -exec rm {} ;
    
    To list all the directories on the default drive:
    
	find \ -print
