NAME
     cecho - echo arguments

SYNTAX
     cecho [ -n ] [ arg ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Echo writes its arguments separated by blanks and terminated
     by a newline on the standard output.  If the flag -n is
     used, no newline is added to the output.

     The following are the expansions of parameters for cecho and the 
     other unix commands (listed in order of expansion):

         \        For quoting the special characters  $  "  '
                  so that their expansions are not interpreted.
                  If the \ precedes any other character, the \ will remain.

      " ... "     For grouping words with expansions (but not file name
                  generation).

      ' ... '     For grouping words, but expansions are not performed.

       $name      For substitution of the environment parameter "name".
                  If name is not found, the NULL string is substituted.

     ${name}...   For expanding the environment parameter "name" when the 
                  parameter is embedded in a string.

         *        For file name generation.  The * represents any string.
         ?        The ? represents any single character.

EXAMPLES
     Assume $PATH = \;\dos; 

           cecho $path            -->   \;\dos;
           cecho ${path}others    -->   \;\dos;others
           cecho "hello \$path"   -->   hello $path
           cecho "hello $path"    -->   hello \;\dos;
           cecho 'hello $path'    -->   hello $path
           cecho *.c              -->   cecho.c  ...
           cecho "*.c"            -->   *.c
           cecho '*.c'            -->   *.c
