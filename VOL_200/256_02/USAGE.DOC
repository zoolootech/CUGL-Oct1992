	USING THE CARRY FLAG FUNCTIONS
	------------------------------

	Most of the functions are either of type 'int' or of type
	'void' so do not need to be declared in the programme or
	function which uses them.   The exceptions to this rule
	are -

	FUN42H     Move File Pointer
	----------------------------

	This returns a 'long' so must be declared as such.   Note
	the code for moving the pointer is defined as -

	     Code     Cursor is moved to
	     ----     ------------------
	      0       Beginning of file plus offset
	      1       Current location plus offset
	      2       End of file plus offset

	GDATIME     Function 57H
	------------------------

	This returns the date (in Microsoft format) as the normal
	'int' return with the date in variable '_rdx'.   For those
	who are not familiar with the way Microsoft specified these
	they are both words (2 bytes) with the information stored
	thus -

 	         HIGH          LOW
	DATE     YYYYYYYM MMMDDDDD    Year, Month and Day

	TIME     HHHHHMMM MMMSSSSS    Hour, Minute and Second

	File Attributes
	---------------

	A number of the functions deal with file attributes.   The
	attributes which are available for use are as follows -

	Code     Description
	----     -----------
	00H      Normal file.   Can be read or written to without
	         any restrictions.
	01H      Read-only file.   Cannot be written to and another
	         file with the same name cannot be created.
	02H      Hidden file.   Will not be found in a directory search.
	04H      System file.   Will not be found in a directory search.
	08H      Volume (disk) name.   Only one file can have this
	         attribute and the file must be in the root directory.
	10H      A subdirectory name.
	20H      The archive flag.   This is set whenever a file is
	         altered (edited) and is cleared by the Backup command.

	Note particularly that the Volume Label code (08H) and the
	Subdirectory code (10H) cannot be changed using Function 43H
	which is included on this disk as the two functions -

	         GETATTR
	         SETATTR
