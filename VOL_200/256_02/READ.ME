
	CARRY FLAG FILES
	----------------

	The files on this disk are practically all of the kind where
	the Carry Flag is set to indicate an error.   They have been
	written in Assembly Language to suit the De Smet Compiler and
	to take advantage of the De Smet flag "_carryf".   They have
	all been written to use INT 21H other than the direct disk
	read/write functions (INT's 25H and 26H) which will be found
	in the DOS1 subdirectory.

	For convenience I have grouped the routines into the following
	categories -

	          DOS1          Routines which first were used in MS-DOS
	                        Version 1.x but which might have been
	                        superceeded by later MS-DOS 2.x routines.
	          ERRORS        All of the present MS-DOS error codes and
	                        a routine ("printerr") to print the error
	                        message when a routine returns an error
	                        code.
	          FUN4BH        The "EXE" and "OVERLAY" functions which
	                        are available under Function 4BH of INT
	                        21H.
	          FILES         Functions relating to specific files such
	                        as opening a file, closing a file and so
	                        on.   They are for use with MS-DOS 2.x and
	                        later versions.
	          MEMORY        Functions which relate to the use of free
	                        memory under MS-DOS 2.x and later.
	          DIRECTRY      Directory functions under MS-DOS 2.x and
	                        later.
	          FUN44H        Most, although not all, of the Microsoft
	                        networking functions which all use INT
	                        21H Function 44H under MS-DOS 2.x and
	                        later.

	In addition there are several files which occur in the main
	directory.   These are -

	          FUN38H        Get the Country data of the system
	          SETCTRY       Set the Country data
	          NETNAME       Obtain the Computer Name using Function
	                        5EH Code 0.
	          GETPSP        Get the Programme Segment Prefix segment
	                        address of the running programme.
	          ENDPROC       Terminate a procedure
	          GETRET        Get Return Code of a child process
	          GETSTATE      Get Verify State of the system (i.e.
	                        whether write operations to disk files
	                        are being verified)

	For a description of the way each file has been written please
	refer to the file -

	          CARRYF.TXT

	which occurs in the main directory of this disk.

	A complete list of the ("_carryf") files in the sub-directories is 
	as given below.   In each case both the source code and the 'bind'
	code (xxxx.O) is given.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Lastly, I have also provided two system utilities namely -

	          LISTFILE.EXE
	          LABEL.EXE

	The first allows you to print out any of the listings given on the
	disk.   It has been set for a standard (US) paper size of 66 lines
	per page.   If the alterable settings don't suit your type of
	printer just ignore these and press 'p' (when you come to the menu)
	to print the file.

	The LABEL programme allows you to enter a Volume (disk) Name at any
	time you wish.   It can also be used to change the existing name of
	a disk.   I believe this function is included in DOS 3.x but I don't
	have DOS 3.x so I wrote my own utility.   It is a good example of
	the type of programme which can be written using De Smet C and the
	routines on this disk.
