     Place the floppy diskette in drive a: and enter: JJBQC-LI
     
     It will:
     
       1. Move all files to the hard disk drive c:
                  jjbkey.h and jjbset.h to c:\include
                  All the rest to c:\bin
       2. Creates the JJB quick library JJB.QLB
                  and load the first show file with JJBQCS1.
     
     You  may  have  noticed  that  JJB tried to delete two files
     which it could not find on the disk drive. That is  the  way
     it should work because Quick C does not like to make a quick
     library  if the file already  exists  on the disk drive.
     
     You should now be in Quick C  looking  at  the  sample  file
     JJBSHOW1.C.  If  you now press 'F5', the file should compile
     and execute.
     
     If you need to exit Quick C, press 'ALT,' 'RETURN', 'X'. 
     
     To re-enter the source file, from DOS enter 'JJBQCS1'.
     
     To  compile  and  execute  'JJBSHOW1.C'  from   DOS   enter:
              C:\BIN>JJBQCS1, then press 'F5'.
     
     You  can  load  any  of  the  five  source examples with the
     following commands from DOS:
     
                     JJBQCS1
                     JJBQCS2
                     JJBQCS3
                     JJBQCS4
                     JJBQCS5
     
     
     To remove all JJB files from drive c: enter: 'JJBREMOV'
     
     This deletes all the JJB files from drive c: doing a reverse
     installation.


QUICK C
======================================================================
***        JJB FINAL INSTALLATION FOR QUICK C PROGRAMMERS          ***
====================================================================== 
     
     The purpose of this installation is to install only the  JJB
     files which are necessary for Quick C programming.
     
     The files are:  JJBKBD.H
                     JJBSET.H
                     JJBQC.OBJ
                     JJBQCINP.OBJ
                     JJBQCDOL.OBJ
     
     Place the JJB diskette in drive a: and enter: 'JJBQC-FI'
     
     Don't forget to delete all JJB files  from  your  hard  disk
     before  you  make the final installation. The entire purpose
     of the final installation is to clean up your hard disk.  So
     please   remove   the   files   as  shown  in  the  learning
     installation.
     
     
     
TURBO C 
======================================================================
***      JJB LEARNING INSTALLATION FOR TURBO C PROGRAMMERS        ***
====================================================================== 
     
     Place the floppy diskette in drive a: and enter: JJBTC-LI
     
     It will:
     
       1. Move all files to the hard disk drive c:
                  jjbkey.h and jjbset.h to c:\tc\include
                  All the rest to c:\tc
       2. Add the object modules to the small library
                  and load the first show file JJBSHOW1.C
     
     You  should  now be in Turbo C and can execute the show file
     by pressing CTRL F9.
     
     
     To remove all JJB files from drive c: enter: 'JJBREMOV'
     
     This deletes all the JJB files from drive c: doing a reverse
     installation.
