                    PC CURSES LICENSE AGREEMENT      
   
   The PC Curses Library Package is a copyrighted software 
   package that is being distributed as shareware.  It is NOT in 
   the public domain. By using or distributing this package, you 
   agree to the conditions presented below: 

   (1) You may use the PC Curses Library for your own personal 
   use; if you find it useful, you are requested to pay a $20 
   registration fee.  If you are using PC Curses in a 
   commercial, professional, or governmental organization, you 
   are granted a limited license, valid for thirty days, to use 
   this package for evaluation purposes only; if you continue to 
   use this package, you must pay the registration fee.  The 
   registration fee entitles you to use the PC Curses library on 
   one machine.  It also includes one free upgrade. 

   (2) Source code is available to registered users only.  
   Source code is also copyrighted, and may NOT be freely copied 
   or distributed.  The price of the source distribution is $20; 
   in addition to the source modules, it include makefiles (as 
   well as a version of the "make" program and other utilities). 
   
   (3) The PC Curses Library (except source) may be freely 
   distributed and copied inside the U.S.; however, you may not 
   charge anything for the distribution.  The distribution must 
   include everything in the original distribution, including 
   this agreement.  You may not distribute this system with any 
   modifications (this includes documentation as well as 
   programs); additions must be placed in separate files and 
   must be clearly marked as such. 
   
   (4) If any part of the PC Curses Library is used in a 
   program, system, or service that is distributed to machines 
   other than the one originally licensed, there is a nominal 
   fee (in addition to the registration fee) and a simple 
   licensing agreement that must be completed.   This fee may be 
   waived if the program or system is distributed as shareware 
   or by a non-profit organization (but the licensing agreement 
   must still be completed).  There are no royalties. 

   (5) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: THE PC CURSES PACKAGE IS SOLD "AS 
   IS" AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO 
   PERFORMANCE OR MERCHANTABILITY.  BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF 
   CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS PACKAGE MAY BE USED, NO WARRANTY 
   OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE IS OFFERED.  THE USER IS 
   ADVISED TO TEST THE PACKAGE THOROUGHLY BEFORE RELYING ON IT.  
   THE USER MUST ASSUME FULL RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND 
   PERFORMANCE OF USING THE PACKAGE.  ANY LIABILITY OF THE 
   AUTHOR OR DISTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO PRODUCT 
   REPLACEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
