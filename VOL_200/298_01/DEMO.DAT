This is a simple demonstration of the curses program
at work.  While only a few features are demonstrated
here, you can get an idea of what the library can do.
The source code is included, so you can also see how
the demo is done.



In this demo, you can use the following commands:
	<CR>	next window (exit after last)
	<BKSP>	previous window
	^B	toggle between bios and direct update
	^C	abort this demo
	^G	beep and flash the screen
	^L	redraw the screen
	^W	update all windows at once


Each one of the boxes on the screen is a separate
window.  Text can be added to and deleted from
windows.  Text attributes can be set; attributes
currently supported are:

    blink, bold, reverse, and underline.



Curses works asynchronously; you can make as many
changes as you want to a window, but the screen is not
actually updated until you call the wrefresh()
function.  This allows you to make many changes before
writing anything.  The wrefresh function only makes
changes on the screen that are necessary, thus
avoiding writing unnecessary characters.



PC Curses is designed for compatibility.  Because
of its closeness to Unix curses, code can be easily
transported between MS-DOS and Unix systems.
Because it uses BIOS screen updates (by default),
it will work on a wide range of MS-DOS systems.
