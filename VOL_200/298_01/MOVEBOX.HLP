		 Commands for the MOVEBOX program 

	Movebox demonstrates popup and moving windows.  In "bounce" mode,
	it should provide a sense of how fast PC Curses can handle windows.

	Any unrecognized keys will exit this program.

	Cursor keys move the box around the screen.

	<Enter> causes the box to "bounce" around the screen.
		The first time, bouncing will be "regular";  the next time,
		it will be randomized; the next time, regular; etc.

	F1	displays this help menu

	F2	toggles direct/Bios screen updating.
		When this program starts running,  direct screen
		updating is used.  This may cause "snow" on certain
		displays.  Hitting F2 will change the screen updating
		to use Bios calls, eliminating the snow and slowing
		down the screen updates.

			  Hit any key to continue  
