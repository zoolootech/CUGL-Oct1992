	        Commands for the PC Curses Demo program
	<CR>	go down to the next window; exits after last window.

	<BKSP>	go up to the previous window

	^B	toggle between bios and direct screen updates
		Bios (default) is slow, but provides greater compatibility.
		Direct is fast, but may be incompatible or cause flicker.

	^C	abort this demo

	^G	beep and flash the screen

	^L	redraw the screen
		Use this command to see the effect of ^B and ^W commands.

	^W	update all windows at once
		Normally, the demo updates the windows one at a time
		(if you use bios screen updating, this will be obvious).
		With this option, all the windows are updating at once,
		eliminating redundant updates.
