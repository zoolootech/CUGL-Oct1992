Dear Robert,
     Enclosed is a floppy disk (IBM format DSDD) with my book review 
of COMPUTER GRAPHICS FOR THE IBM PC.
     Also on the disk is C source code for atof() and strtod(). I 
wrote it because Aztec C86 has a bug in atof(), scheduled to be fixed 
in the next release, and does not have any strtod() at all. 
     I am passing it along in case someone else might find it useful. 
     The enclosed atof() was written solely by me, and I release it 
into the public domain without restictions.
     Regards,

P.S. Pleaese drop the enclosed postcard in the mail so I will know 
this disk arrived.
