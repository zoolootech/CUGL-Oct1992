I am submitting the following three programs to the public domain in care
of the C users group:

	DIFF.EXE	A file differencer program roughly patterned
			after the UNIX utility of the same name.  It
			has UNIX-style output, and uses an interesting
			differencing algorithm, the "recursive longest
			matching sequence" algorithm.

	DELTA.EXE	A variation of the DIFF utility which generates
			files suitable for passing to the UNIX editor 'ed'
			to generate a new file based on an existing file
			and a delta file.  It can be used to effect a very
			primitive source code control system, or as a basis
			for developing a full-featured SCCS.

	APPLY.EXE	A utility which will apply a delta created using 
			DELTA.EXE to a source file.  This effectively mimics
			the operation of UNIX ed's script editing.


These utilities were all developed under Microsoft OS/2 version 1.0 and 1.1,
using the MS C version 5.1 compiler.  They use no OS/2 specific calls, and
should be portable to any ANSI standard compiler (and probably even a straight
K & R compiler with slight modification).

A note to OS/2 users:

	These routines use only family API calls, and therfore can be bound
	(using the MS BIND utility) to run under MS-DOS 3.X as well as
	MS-OS/2 1.X.
