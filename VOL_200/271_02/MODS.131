Version 1.31:
    Bug Fixed 10-16-87 -- monthis() returns one month earlier than expected

With Version 1.5 of Turbo-C, Borland has added a file named GRAPHICS.H,
   which, of course, conflicts with the same filename in this library.
   I have graciously <grin> allowed Borland to use the filename, and
   have renamed my file to SMGRAPH.H.

Added:
    exparg();
    untab();

Recompiled all libraries with Turbo-C Version 1.5
Added third distribution disk to FULL registrations only, containing
the original Turbo-C 1.0 compiled libraries.
