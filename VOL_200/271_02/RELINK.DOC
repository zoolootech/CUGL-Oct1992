This information is provided here since the main users manual was
already finished when I decided to provide the batch files and
library response files to allow remaking the libraries.

If you want to remake the entire library, the procedure can be
automated with a series of batch files and librarian response files.

You will need, besides Turbo-C of course, Microsoft MASM assembler and
the LIB librarian utility which comes with MASM, or TLIB which comes
with Turbo-C Version 1.5.

There are 5 batch files and 5 librarian response files:
     MAKES.BAT    LIBSMAL           Small memory model
     MAKEC.BAT    LIBCOMP           Compact memory model
     MAKEM.BAT    LIBMED            Medium memory model
     MAKEL.BAT    LIBLARG           Large memory model
     MAKEH.BAT    LIBHUGE           Huge memory model

The MAKE* files for using Borland's TLIB program are
names the same, except prefaced with the letter "T":
    TMAKES.BAT
         etc.
and the TLIB repsonse file is TLIBLIST for all memory models.


To remake the libraries, you will most likely need to be on a
hard disk.  I don't think a dual floppy system can handle it all
in one chunk.  If you have a floppy system, you will have to remake
the library in pieces, bringing in only a few source files at a time.

On a hard drive, make a subdirectory and copy onto it all source and header
files, plus the above named batch and lib* files from the "Steve's Library"
distribution disk.  Make sure that this directory does NOT have the
library files SMTC*.LIB!

Then, making sure that TCC.EXE, MASM.EXE, and LIB.EXE or TLIB.EXE
are in your current PATH, simply execute each of the batch files.
They will recompile and reassemble each source files and then create
a new library file from the OBJ files.
Copy the object files into the directory which has the Turbo-C
library files, and then you can delete everything in the working directory.

If you choose to keep the working directory on disk, you can save space
after remaking the files by doing:
              erase *.obj
              erase *.lst

The batch files and librarian response files are only supplied with
full source registration.
