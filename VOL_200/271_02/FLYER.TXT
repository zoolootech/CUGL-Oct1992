         SEM  Software  is  a  growing  collection  of shareware software
         products for the MS-DOS community.  Prices are  reasonable,  and
         quality  is  high,  since  all software is created by a fulltime
         professional  software  engineer  with   a   Chicago   high-tech
         consulting firm.   Help to registered users is available through
         Compuserve, GEnie, or mail.  Orders and inquiries  are  normally
         processed within  48  hours.   Free trial copies of all software
         may be obtained  from  Compuserve  (IBMSIG),  Public  (Software)
         Library  of Houston, GEnie, and many systems around the country.
         Unless noted otherwise, all programs  operate  under  MS-DOS  or
         PC-DOS  2.1 and above, on IBM XTs, ATs, or compatibles, and will
         work on MDA, Hercules, CGA, and EGA video cards.
                        FOR PRINTING AND TEXT PROCESSING:

              *****   SUPER PRINT   *****
              The ultimate in printing utilities,  SUPER  PRINT  has
              just   about  any  printing  feature  which  could  be
              desired.  SUPER PRINT will print files  with  embedded
              control   characters,   will  slash  zeros,  add  line
              numbers, add left margin space for  three-hole  paper,
              page  number, print file time and date in heading, and
              other stuff.  Recent  additions  include  page  length
              setting,  top and bottom margins, wild card filenames,
              prompted   printing,   printer   configuration   file,
              adjustable tab  expansion, and more!  This is also one
              of the few printing utilties which may be  the  target
              of piped data from another program.  Now, version 2.70
              includes  even  more enhancements, including character
              translation capabilities.  The most software  you  can
              get for only $10!

              ******   NEAT   *****
              This  is  a  text  formatting  program similar to UNIX
              nroff, except oriented to the PC user.  Virtually  any
              printer  can be supported with several different fonts
              or ribbon options.  This program also has file merging
              features for creating form letters merged with address
              lists, or other such uses.










         








         


                           FOR C LANGUAGE PROGRAMMERS:

              *****   STEVE'S TURBO-C LIBRARY   *****
              This expansion library for Borland's Turbo-C has  over
              130 functions and growing.  Although Version 1.5 of TC
              contains  direct  video  access, "Steve's Library" was
              the FIRST to contain a full library  of  direct  video
              text functions for this compiler.  Many users say that
              my  functions  are  even better and easier to use than
              Borland's.  The library includes complete source  code
              in  C and assembler, plus several useful header files.
              Included are printer BIOS service  routines  for  fast
              printer  access,  and  async communications functions,
              directly accessing the serial ports  for  fast  access
              without buffering.  Up to 9600 baud is possible!
              Need to accept wildcard filenames on the command line?
              My  exparg()  function  re-arranges (argc, argv) to an
              expanded array with all wildcards expanded to matching
              filenames.
              An installable interrupt handler for  the  18.2  Hertz
              interrupt   is   included  so  that  simple  real-time
              applications can be  programmed  which  will  function
              properly regardless of the type of system in use.
              Functions  for  file  opening  from PATH and specified
              environment variables make opening a file anywhere  in
              the environment totally transparent to the programmer.
              And  now,  support  is  also  included  for the switch
              inputs on the game port!   This  4-bit  port  is  very
              handy  for reading switches or other logic levels from
              any outside device.
              Full documentation suitable for printing  and  placing
              in  a  binder  is  provided,  along  with a utility to
              automate the printing.
              To demonstrate various functions from STEVE'S LIBRARY,
              six utilites with  source  code  are  included.    The
              utilities include:
              GTOD - Reports time and date in many formats
              TC - Compare two text files and report differences
              WC  -  Count  words,  lines, characters, and checksums
              files
              OKISET -  Configure  an  Okidata  Printer  or  similar
              IBM-type printer
              INPATH - Locate an executable file in current PATH
              DUMP - Unique hex dump program in COLOR, with optional
              highlighted bytes.

              *****   STEVE'S DATALIGHT LIBRARY   *****
              This  expansion  library  for Datalight C has over 100
              functions.  Much of "Steve's Library" for Turbo - C is
              included, except the  direct  video  (which  Datalight
              provides).   However,  "Steve's Library" provides much
              of  what  Datalight  forgot,  like  control-break  and


         








         


              critical   error   interrupt   handlers,  device  type
              interrogation functions, a game  port  handler,  async
              functions, direct  printer  functions,  and more.  All
              functions have been optimized for Datalight,  and  the
              six demonstration utilities are included as well.




                           FOR AMATEUR RADIO OPERATORS

              *****   CONLOG   *****
              This  is  the  first  in  what will become a series of
              contest  logging  programs  for  the   Amateur   Radio
              Operator.   CONLOG is intended for the annual November
              Sweepstakes.  This package is more than  one  program.
              There is a logging program for use during the contest,
              and  two  support  programs  to  print  the  resulting
              logsheets, summary, and duplicate check sheets.    All
              forms   are  printed  with  slick  graphics  (for  IBM
              compatible printers only), but can be also printed  on
              non-IBM printers without the graphics.  The forms have
              been  approved  by  the  ARRL  for submission as valid
              contest entries.    Extra  care  has  been  taken   to
              preserve all log entries, even if there is a system or
              power failure.    The  user  can  configure  all video
              attributes,  plus  name,   QTH,   rig,   and   section
              information.   This  program  is the result of various
              programs written over the last  seven  years  for  the
              Sweepstakes.  No guarantees are made, but MY score has
              increased by over 25% as a result of computer logging!
              And  the  time  saved  in re-copying the logs (to make
              them readable!) is incredible.  My  entry  is  usually
              ready  for  mailing about 30 minutes after the contest
              ends.  All new contest rules are supported,  including
              the  new West Texas section, and QRP power precedence.
              Provisions are made to  edit  or  delete  log  entries
              during  the  contest,  and the program absolutely will
              not let you log a duplicate callsign!  Log size  is  a
              hefty  2500  entries  to  cover  even  you guys in the
              COLorado section.  Try it once, and  throw  away  your
              pencil!   And  when  you  work  the contest, say hi to
              WA9DRE when we work!
