                         CHECK REGISTER PROGRAM

Unfortunately, an error was discovered in version 1.0 of both CHECKS.COM
and CLEARS.COM (see below).  The error would not normally be observed if
the Count associated with Trmini in CHECKS.SCR was less than 7 (see p. 8
of the document).  This library contains CHECKS11.COM and CLEARS11.COM,
which represent version 1.1 of each.

The Check Register Program simplifies the task of managing one or more
checking accounts.  Because of its size, the program was originally
provided as two separate library files named CHX8010A.LBR and
CHX8010B.LBR.  The filenames were derived from the following:
