        1.0  How to Use the Cross-Assembler Package

             First, the question, "What does a cross-assembler do?" needs 
        to be addressed as there is considerable confusion on this point.  
        A cross-assembler is just like any other assembler except that it 
        runs on some CPU other than the one for which it assembles code.  
        For example, this package assembles 8051 source code into 8051
        object code, but it runs on an 8080, a Z-80, an 8088, or whatever 
        other CPU you happen to have a C compiler for.  The reason that 
        cross-assemblers are useful is that you probably already have a 
        CPU with memory, disk drives, a text editor, an operating system, 
        and all sorts of hard-to-build or expensive facilities on hand.  
        A cross-assembler allows you to use these facilites to develop 
        code for an 8051.

        This program requires one input file (your 8051 source code) and 
        zero to two output files (the listing and the object).  The input 
        file MUST be specified, or the assembler will bomb on a fatal 
        error.  The listing and object files are optional.  If no listing 
        file is specified, no listing is generated, and if no object file 
        is specified, no object is generated.  If the object file is 
        specified, the object is written to this file in "Intel 
        hexadecimal" format.

             The command line for the cross-assembler looks like this:

                  A51 source_file { >list_file } { -o object_file }

        where the { } indicates that the specified item is optional.

             Some examples are in order:

             a51 test51.asm                          source:   test51.asm
                                                     listing:  none
                                                     object:   none

             a51 test51.asm -l test51.prn            source:   test51.asm
                                                     listing:  test51.prn
                                                     object:   none

             a51 test51.asm -o test51.hex            source:   test51.asm
                                                     listing:  none
                                                     object:   test51.hex

             a51 test51.asm -l test51.prn -o test51.hex
                                                     source:   test51.asm
                                                     listing:  test51.prn
                                                     object:   test51.hex

             The order in which the source, listing, and object files are 
        specified does not matter.  Note that no default file name exten-
        sions are supplied by the assembler as this gives rise to porta-
        bility problems.

        2.0  Format of Cross-Assembler Source Lines

             The source file that the cross-assembler processes into a 
        listing and an object is an ASCII text file that you can prepare 
        with whatever editor you have at hand.  The most-significant 
        (parity) bit of each character is cleared as the character is 
        read from disk by the cross-assembler, so editors that set this 
        bit (such as WordStar's document mode) should not bother this 
        program.  All printing characters, the ASCII TAB character (09H), 
        and newline character(s) are processed by the assembler.  All 
        other characters are passed through to the listing file, but are 
        otherwise ignored.

             The source file is divided into lines by newline char-
        acter(s).  The internal buffers of the cross-assembler will 
        accommodate lines of up to 255 characters which should be more 
        than ample for almost any job.  If you must use longer lines, 
        change the constant MAXLINE in file A51.H and recompile the 
        cross-assembler.  Otherwise, you will overflow the buffers, and 
        the program will mysteriously crash.

             Each source line is made up of three fields:  the label 
        field, the opcode field, and the argument field.  The label field 
        is optional, but if it is present, it must begin in column 1.  
        The opcode field is optional, but if it is present, it must not 
        begin in column 1.  If both a label and an opcode are present, 
        one or more spaces and/or TAB characters must separate the two.  
        If the opcode requires arguments, they are placed in the argument 
        field which is separated from the opcode field by one or more 
        spaces and/or TAB characters.  Finally, an optional comment can 
        be added to the end of the line.  This comment must begin with a 
        semicolon which signals the assembler to pass the rest of the 
        line to the listing and otherwise ignore it.  Thus, the source 
        line looks like this:

             {label}{ opcode{ arguments}}{;commentary}

        where the { } indicates that the specified item is optional.

             Some examples are in order:

          column 1
             |
             v
             GRONK   DJNZ  R1, LOOP        ; This line has everything.
                     INC   R1              ; This line has no label.
             BEEP                          ; This line has no opcode.
             ; This line has no label and no opcode.

             ; The previous line has nothing at all.
                     END                   ; This line has no argument.

        2.1  Labels

             A label is any sequence of alphabetic or numeric characters 
        starting with an alphabetic.  The legal alphabetics are:

                   ! $ % & : ? [ \ ] ^ _  ` { | }  ~  A-Z  a-z

        The numeric characters are the digits 0-9.  Note that "A" is not 
        the same as "a" in a label.  This can explain mysterious U 
        (undefined label) errors occurring when a label appears to be 
        defined.

             A label is permitted on any line except a line where the 
        opcode is IF, ELSE, or ENDIF.  The label is assigned the value of 
        the assembly program counter before any of the rest of the line 
        is processed except when the opcode is BIT, EQU, ORG, REG, or 
        SET.

             Labels can have the same name as opcodes, but they cannot
        have the same name as pre-defined bit variables, operators, 
        registers, or pre-defined byte addresses.  The reserved names 
        are:

             Pre-defined bit variables:

             AC        CY        EA        ES        ET0       ET1
             EX0       EX1       F0        IE0       IE1       IT0
             IT1       OV        P         PS        PT0       PT1
             PX0       PX1       RS0       RS1       RB8       REN
             RI        SM0       SM1       SM2       TB8       TF0
             TF1       TI        TR0       TR1

             Operators:

             AND       EQ        GE        GT        HIGH      LE
             LOW       LT        MOD       NE        NOT       OR
             SHL       SHR       XOR

             Registers:

             A         AB        C         DPTR      PC        R0
             R1        R2        R3        R4        R5        R6
             R7

             Pre-defined byte addresses:

             $         ACC       B         DPH       DPL       IE
             IP        P0        P1        P2        P3        PCON
             PSW       SBUF      SCON      SP        TCON      TH0
             TH1       TL0       TL1       TMOD

             If a label is used in an expression before it is assigned a 
        value, the label is said to be "forward-referenced."  For 
        example:



                                        5



             L1   EQU  L2 + 1   ; L2 is forward-referenced here.
             L2
             L3   EQU  L2 + 1   ; L2 is not forward-referenced here.


        2.2  Numeric Constants

             Numeric constants are formed according to the Intel 
        convention.  A numeric constant starts with a numeric character 
        (0-9), continues with zero or more digits (0-9, A-F), and ends 
        with an optional base designator.  The base designators are H for 
        hexadecimal, none or D for decimal, O or Q for octal, and B for 
        binary.  The hex digits a-f are converted to upper case by the 
        assembler.  Note that a numeric constant cannot begin with A-F as 
        it would be indistinguishable from a label.  Thus, all of the 
        following evaluate to 255 (decimal):

                   0ffH   255   255D   377O   377Q   11111111B


        2.3  String Constants

             A string constant is zero or more characters enclosed in 
        either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").  Single quotes 
        only match single quotes, and double quotes only match double 
        quotes, so if you want to put a single quote in a string, you can 
        do it like this:  "'".  In all contexts except the DB statement, 
        the first character or two of the string constant are all that 
        are used.  The rest is ignored.  Noting that the ASCII codes for 
        "A" and "B" are $41 and $42, respectively, will explain the 
        following examples:

                  "" and ''           evaluate to $0000
                  "A" and 'A'         evaluate to $0041
                  "AB"                evaluates to $4142

        Note that the null string "" is legal and evaluates to $0000.


        2.4  Expressions

             An expression is made up of labels, numeric constants, and 
        string constants glued together with arithmetic operators, 
        logical operators, and parentheses in the usual way that 
        algebraic expressions are made.  Operators have the following 
        fairly natural order of precedence:

             Highest        anything in parentheses
                            unary +, unary -
                            *, /, MOD, SHL, SHR
                            binary +, binary -
                            LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT, NE
                            NOT
                            AND
                            OR, XOR

             Lowest         HIGH, LOW

             A few notes about the various operators are in order:

             1)   The remainder operator MOD yields the remainder from 
                  dividing its left operand by its right operand.

             2)   The shifting operators SHL and SHR shift their left 
                  operand to the left or right the number of bits 
                  specified by their right operand.

             3)   The relational operators LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT, and NE can 
                  also be written as <, <= or =<, =, >= or =>, and <> or 
                  ><, respectively.  They evaluate to 0FFFFH if the 
                  statement is true, 0 otherwise.

             4)   The logical opeators NOT, AND, OR, and XOR do bitwise 
                  operations on their operand(s).

             5)   HIGH and LOW extract the high or low byte, of an 
                  expression.

             6)   The special symbol $ can be used in place of a label or 
                  constant to represent the value of the program counter 
                  before any of the current line has been processed.

             Some examples are in order at this point:

             2 + 3 * 4                          evaluates to 14
             (2 + 3) * 4                        evaluates to 20
             NOT %11110000 XOR %00001010        evaluates to %00000101
             HIGH 1234H SHL 1                   evaluates to $0024
             001Q EQ 0                          evaluates to 0
             001Q = 2 SHR 1                     evaluates to $FFFF

             All arithmetic is unsigned with overflow from the 16-bit 
        word ignored.  Thus:

             32768 * 2                          evaluates to 0


        2.5  Bit Expressions

             Byte addresses are specified by expressions as described 
        above.  Bit addresses are specified by a special type of 
        expression which can take the following three forms:

             1)   bit_variable

                       Bit variables are declared with the BIT pseudo-op.  
                  A number of bit variables are pre-defined by the 
                  assembler such as OV for the overflow flag (bit 2 of 
                  location 0E0H).

             2)   expression_1 . expression_2


                                        7




                       This yields the bit address of bit expression_2 of 
                  location expression_1.  expression_1 must in the range 
                  20H - 2FH or an even multiple of 8 in the range 80H - 
                  0FFH.  expression_2 must be in the range 0 - 7.  An 
                  illegal value in either expression will cause a V 
                  (value) error.

             3)   expression

                       An expression can also specify a bit address by 
                  itself.


        3.0  Machine Opcodes

             The opcodes of the 8051 processor are divided into groups 
        below by the type of arguments required in the argument field of 
        the source line.  If an opcode requires multiple arguments, these 
        must be placed in the argument field in order (unless otherwise 
        specified) and separated by commas.  Some shorthand notations 
        will be used.  They are:

             #imm means     immediate value (e.g. #012H) in the range
                                 -128 to +255
             bit  means     bit expression as described in section 2.5
             dir  means     byte address in the range 0 - 0FFH
             rel  means     byte address as described in section 3.6
             Rn   means     R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, or R7


        3.1  Opcodes -- No Arguments

             The following opcodes allow no arguments at all in their 
        argument fields:

             dir                           POP, PUSH
             A, Rn, @R0, @R1, or dir       DEC
             A, DPTR, Rn, @R0, @R1, or dir INC
             C, or bit                     SETB
             A, C, or bit                  CLR, CPL
             @A + DPTR                     JMP



                                        8

             A                   dir, Rn, @R0, or @R1     XCH
             A                   dir, #imm, Rn, @R0,      ADD, ADDC, ANL,
                                   or @R1                   ORL, SUBB, XRL
             dir                 A, or #imm               ANL, ORL, XRL
             C                   bit, or /bit             ANL, ORL
             bit                 rel                      JB, JBC, JNB
             Rn, or @Rn          rel                      DJNZ


        3.4  Opcodes -- Two Arguments in Either Order

             The following opcodes require two arguments in either order:

             Argument 1          Argument 2               Opcode

             A                   @DPTR, @R0, or @R1       MOVX


        3.5  Opcodes -- Three Arguments in Order

             The CJNE opcode requires three arguments in order.  Two sets 
        of arguments are allowed as follows:

             Argument 1          Argument 2          Argument 3

             A                   dir or #imm         rel
             Rn, @R0, or @R1     #imm                rel


        3.6  Opcodes -- Relative Branches

             The opcodes in this group require one argument.  It is an 
        arithmetic expression that evaluates to an address in the range 
        -128 to +127 bytes from the address of the first byte of the NEXT 
        instruction.  The opcodes are:

             JC        JNC       JNZ       JZ        SJMP


        3.7  Opcodes -- Absolute Branches

             These opcodes require one argument.  It is an arithmetic 
        expression that evaluates to an address on the same 2K page as 
        the NEXT instruction.  The opcodes are:



                                        9



                       ACALL               AJMP


        3.8  Opcodes -- Long Branches

        arithmetic expression with any value.

                       LCALL               LJMP

        has the allowable combinations marked with an X:

              First                 Second Argument
             Argument       A  #imm  dir  Rn  @R0  @R1  bit  C
                A                X    X   X    X    X
               dir          X    X    X   X    X    X
                Rn          X    X    X
               @R0          X    X    X
               @R1          X    X    X
               bit                                           X
                C                                        X
              DPTR               *

             * = The immediate value in this case (only) is not 
                 restricted to the range -128 to +255.


        4.0  Pseudo Opcodes

             Unlike 8051 opcodes, pseudo opcodes (pseudo-ops) do not 
        represent machine instructions.  They are, rather, directives to 
        the assembler.  These directives require various numbers and 
        types of arguments.  They will be listed individually below.


        4.1  Pseudo-ops -- BIT

             The BIT pseudo-op allows the user to create bit variables.  
        It takes the following form:

             label     BIT       bit_expression

        The label is mandatory.  If it is missing, the assembler will 
        generate an L (label) error.


        4.2  Pseudo-ops -- DB

             The DB pseudo-op allows arbitrary bytes to be spliced into 
        the object code.  Its argument is a chain of zero or more 
        expressions that evaluate to -128 through 255 separated by 


                                       10



        commas.  If a comma occurs with no preceding expression, a 00H 
        byte is spliced into the object code.  The sequence of bytes 
        0FEH, 0FFH, 00H, 01H, 02H could be spliced into the code with the 
        following statement:

                       DB        -2, -1, , 1, 2

        A special case exists here.  If a string constant is entered with 
        no arithmetic done on it, then the entire string is spliced into 
        the code stream.  Thus, the sequence of bytes 002H, 043H, 041H, 
        054H, 044H could be spliced into the code with the following 
        statement:

                       DB        1 + 1, "CAT", "C" + 1


        4.3  Pseudo-ops -- DS

             The DS pseudo-op is used to reserve a block of storage for 
        program variables, or whatever.  This storage is not initialized 
        in any way, so its value at run time will usually be random.  The 
        argument expression (which may contain no forward references) is 
        added to the assembly program counter.  The following statement 
        would reserve 10 bytes of storage called "STORAGE":

             STORAGE   DS        10


        4.4  Pseudo-ops -- DW

             The DW pseudo-op allows 16-bit words to be spliced into the 
        object code.  Its argument is a chain of zero or more expressions 
        separated by commas.  If a comma occurs with no preceding 
        expression, a word of 0000H is spliced into the code.  The word 
        is placed into memory high byte in low address, low byte in high 
        address -- the opposite of standard Intel order.  The sequence of
        bytes 0FFH, 0FEH, 00H, 00H, 01H, 02H could be spliced into the
        code with the following statement:

                       DW        0FFFEH, , 0102H


        4.5  Pseudo-ops -- END

             The END pseudo-op tells the assembler that the source 
        program is over.  Any further lines of the source file are 
        ignored and not passed on to the listing.  If an argument is 
        added to the END statement, the value of the argument will be 
        placed in the execution address slot in the Intel hex object 
        file.  The execution address defaults to the program counter 
        value at the point where the END was encountered.  Thus, to 
        specify that the program starts at label START, the END statement 
        would be:

                       END       START


                                       11




             If end-of-file is encountered on the source file before an 
        END statement is reached, the assembler will add an END statement 
        to the listing and flag it with a * (missing statement) error.


        4.6  Pseudo-ops -- EQU

             The EQU pseudo-op is used to assign a specific value to a 
        label, thus the label on this line is REQUIRED.  Once the value 
        is assigned, it cannot be reassigned by writing the label in 
        column 1, by another EQU statement by a REG statement, or by a 
        SET statement.  Thus, for example, the following statement 
        assigns the value 2 to the label TWO:

             TWO       EQU       1 + 1

             The expression in the argument field must contain no forward 
        references.


        4.7  Pseudo-ops -- IF, ELSE, ENDIF

             These three pseudo-ops allow the assembler to choose whether 
        or not to assemble certain blocks of code based on the result of 
        an expression.  Code that is not assembled is passed through to 
        the listing but otherwise ignored by the assembler.  The IF 
        pseudo-op signals the beginning of a conditionally assembled 
        block.  It requires one argument that may contain no forward 
        references.  If the value of the argument is non-zero, the block 
        is assembled.  Otherwise, the block is ignored.  The ENDIF 
        pseudo-op signals the end of the conditionally assembled block.  
        For example:

                       IF   EXPRESSION     ;This whole thing generates
                       DB   01H, 02H, 03H  ;  no code whatsoever if
                       ENDIF               ;  EXPRESSION is zero.

        The ELSE pseudo-op allows the assembly of either one of two 
        blocks, but not both.  The following two sequences are 
        equivalent:

                       IF   EXPRESSION
                       ... some stuff ...
                       ELSE
                       ... some more stuff ...
                       ENDIF

             TEMP_LAB  SET  EXPRESSION
                       IF   TEMP_LAB NE 0
                       ... some stuff ...
                       ENDIF
                       IF   TEMP_LAB EQ 0
                       ... some more stuff ...
                       ENDIF


                                       12




             The pseudo-ops in this group do NOT permit labels to exist 
        on the same line as the status of the label (ignored or not) 
        would be ambiguous.

             All IF statements (even those in ignored conditionally 
        assembled blocks) must have corresponding ENDIF statements and 
        all ELSE and ENDIF statements must have a corresponding IF 
        statement.

             IF blocks can be nested up to 16 levels deep before the 
        assembler dies of a fatal error.  This should be adequate for any 
        conceivable job, but if you need more, change the constant 
        IFDEPTH in file A51.H and recompile the assembler.


        4.8  Pseudo-ops -- INCL

             The INCL pseudo-op is used to splice the contents of another 
        file into the current file at assembly time.  The name of the 
        file to be INCLuded is specified as a normal string constant, so 
        the following line would splice the contents of file "const.def" 
        into the source code stream:

                       INCL      "const.def"

             INCLuded files may, in turn, INCLude other files until four 
        files are open simultaneously.  This limit should be enough for 
        any conceivable job, but if you need more, change the constant 
        FILES in file A51.H and recompile the assembler.


        4.9  Pseudo-ops -- ORG

             The ORG pseudo-op is used to set the assembly program 
        counter to a particular value.  The expression that defines this 
        value may contain no forward references.  The default initial 
        value of the assembly program counter is 0000H.  The following 
        statement would change the assembly program counter to 0F000H:

                       ORG       0F000H

             If a label is present on the same line as an ORG statement, 
        it is assigned the new value of the assembly program counter.


        4.10 Pseudo-ops -- PAGE

             The PAGE pseudo-op always causes an immediate page ejection 
        in the listing by inserting a form feed ('\f') character before 
        the next line.  If an argument is specified, the argument 
        expression specifies the number of lines per page in the listing.  
        Legal values for the expression are any number except 1 and 2.  A 
        value of 0 turns the listing pagination off.  Thus, the following 
        statement cause a page ejection and would divide the listing into 


                                       13



        60-line pages:

                       PAGE      60


        4.11 Pseudo-ops -- REG

             The REG pseudo-op functions like the EQU pseudo-op except 
        that the argument must be a register -- i.e. R0 - R7 or another 
        label defined with the REG pseudo-op.  A label defined with REG 
        can be used anywhere that R0 - R7 is called for.  This includes 
        forms like @LABEL.  Like the EQU statement, the argument 
        expression must contain no forward references.  A label defined 
        with the REG statement cannot be redefined by writing it in 
        column 1, by an EQU statement, by another REG statement, or by a 
        SET statement.  The following pair of statements will assemble to 
        a "MOV @R0, A" instruction:

             TEMP      REG       R0
                       MOV       @TEMP, A


        4.12 Pseudo-ops -- SET

             The SET pseudo-op functions like the EQU pseudo-op except 
        that the SET statement can reassign the value of a label that has 
        already been assigned by another SET statement.  Like the EQU 
        statement, the argument expression may contain no forward 
        references.  A label defined by a SET statement cannot be 
        redefined by writing it in column 1 or with an EQU statement.  
        The following series of statements would set the value of label 
        "COUNT" to 1, 2, then 3:

             COUNT     SET       1
             COUNT     SET       2
             COUNT     SET       3


        4.13 Pseudo-ops -- TITL

             The TITL pseudo-op sets the running title for the listing.  
        The argument field is required and must be a string constant, 
        though the null string ("") is legal.  This title is printed 
        after every page ejection in the listing, therefore, if page 
        ejections have not been forced by the PAGE pseudo-op, the title 
        will never be printed.  The following statement would print the 
        title "Random Bug Generator -- Ver 3.14159" at the top of every 
        page of the listing:

                       TITL      "Random Bug Generator -- Ver 3.14159"


        5.0  Assembly Errors

             When a source line contains an illegal construct, the line 


                                       14



        is flagged in the listing with a single-letter code describing 
        the error.  The meaning of each code is listed below.  In 
        addition, a count of the number of lines with errors is kept and 
        printed on the C "stderr" device (by default, the console) after 
        the END statement is processed.  If more than one error occurs in 
        a given line, only the first is reported.  For example, the 
        illegal label "=$#*'(" would generate the following listing line:

             L  0000   FF 00 00      =$#*'(     LDA       R0


        5.1  Error * -- Illegal or Missing Statement

             This error occurs when either:

             1)   the assembler reaches the end of the source file 
                  without seeing an END statement, or

             2)   an END statement is encountered in an INCLude file.

             If you are "sure" that the END statement is present when the 
        assembler thinks that it is missing, it probably is in the 
        ignored section of an IF block.  If the END statement is missing, 
        supply it.  If the END statement is in an INCLude file, delete 
        it.


        5.2  Error ( -- Parenthesis Imbalance

             For every left parenthesis, there must be a right paren-
        thesis.  Count them.


        5.3  Error " -- Missing Quotation Mark

             Strings have to begin and end with either " or '.  Remember 
        that " only matches " while ' only matches '.


        5.4  Error B -- Branch Target Out of Bounds

             The 8051 relative branch instructions will only reach 
        addresses that are within -128 and +127 bytes of the first byte 
        of the next instruction.  The 8051 absolute branch instructions 
        will only reach addresses on the same 2K page as the next 
        instruction.  If this error occurs, the source code will have to 
        be rearranged to bring the branch target within range or a long 
        branch instruction that will reach anywhere will have to be used.


        5.5  Error D -- Illegal Digit

             This error occurs if a digit greater than or equal to the 
        base of a numeric constant is found.  For example, a 2 in a 
        binary number would cause a D error.  Especially, watch for 8 or 


                                       15



        9 in an octal number.


        5.6  Error E -- Illegal Expression

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a missing expression where one is required

             2)   a unary operator used as a binary operator or vice-
                  versa

             3)   a missing binary operator

             4)   a SHL or SHR count that is not 0 thru 15


        5.7  Error I -- IF-ENDIF Imbalance

             For every IF there must be a corresponding ENDIF.  If this 
        error occurs on an ELSE or ENDIF statement, the corresponding IF 
        is missing.  If this error occurs on an END statement, one or 
        more ENDIF statements are missing.


        5.8  Error L -- Illegal Label

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a non-alphabetic in column 1

             2)   a reserved word used as a label

             3)   a missing label on a BIT, EQU, REG, or SET statement

             4)   a label on an IF, ELSE, or ENDIF statement


        5.9  Error M -- Multiply Defined Label

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a label defined in column 1 or with the EQU statement 
                  being redefined

             2)   a label defined by a SET statement being redefined 
                  either in column 1 or with the EQU statement

             3)   the value of the label changing between assembly passes


        5.10 Error O -- Illegal Opcode

             The opcode field of a source line may contain only a valid 
        machine opcode, a valid pseudo-op, or nothing at all.  Anything 


                                       16



        else causes this error.


        5.11 Error P -- Phasing Error

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a forward reference in a BLK, CPU, EQU, ORG, or SET 
                  statement

             2)   a label disappearing between assembly passes


        5.12 Error S -- Illegal Syntax

             This error means that an argument field is scrambled.  Sort 
        the mess out and reassemble.  In particular, look for use of 
        registers that don't apply to a particular opcode, missing 
        commas, and the like.


        5.13 Error T -- Too Many Arguments

             This error occurs if there are more items (expressions, 
        register designators, etc.) in the argument field than the opcode 
        or pseudo-op requires.  The assembler ignores the extra items but 
        issues this error in case something is really mangled.


        5.14 Error U -- Undefined Label

             This error occurs if a label is referenced in an expression 
        but not defined anywhere in the source program.  If you are 
        "sure" you have defined the label, note that upper and lower case 
        letters in labels are different.  Defining "LABEL" does not 
        define "Label."


        5.15 Error V -- Illegal Value

             This error occurs because:

             1)   an immediate value is not -128 thru 255, or

             2)   a direct address is not 0 thru 255, or

             3)   a bit expression contains an illegal address or bit 
                  number, or

             4)   a DB argument is not -128 thru 255, or

             5)   an INCL argument refers to a file that does not exist.


        6.0  Warning Messages


                                       17




             Some errors that occur during the parsing of the cross-
        assembler command line are non-fatal.  The cross-assembler flags 
        these with a message on the C "stdout" device (by default, the 
        console) beginning with the word "Warning."  The messages are 
        listed below:


        6.1  Warning -- Illegal Option Ignored

             The only options that the cross-assembler knows are -l and  
        -o.  Any other command line argument beginning with - will draw 
        this error.


        6.2  Warning -- -l Option Ignored -- No File Name
        6.3  Warning -- -o Option Ignored -- No File Name

             The -l and -o options require a file name to tell the 
        assembler where to put the listing file or object file.  If this 
        file name is missing, the option is ignored.


        6.4  Warning -- Extra Source File Ignored

             The cross-assembler will only assemble one file at a time, 
        so source file names after the first are ignored.  To assemble a 
        second file, invoke the assembler again.  Note that under CP/M-
        80, the old trick of reexecuting a core image will NOT work as 
        the initialized data areas are not reinitialized prior to the 
        second run.


        6.5  Warning -- Extra Listing File Ignored
        6.6  Warning -- Extra Object File Ignored

             The cross-assembler will only generate one listing and 
        object file per assembly run, so -l and -o options after the 
        first are ignored.


        7.0  Fatal Error Messages

             Several errors that occur during the parsing of the cross-
        assembler command line or during the assembly run are fatal.  The 
        cross-assembler flags these with a message on the C "stdout" 
        device (by default, the console) beginning with the words "Fatal 
        Error."  The messages are explained below:


        7.1  Fatal Error -- No Source File Specified

             This one is self-explanatory.  The assembler does not know 
        what to assemble.



                                       18




        7.2  Fatal Error -- Source File Did Not Open

             The assembler could not open the source file.  The most 
        likely cause is that the source file as specified on the command 
        line does not exist.  On larger systems, there could also be 
        priviledge violations.  Rarely, a read error in the disk 
        directory could cause this error.


        7.3  Fatal Error -- Listing File Did Not Open
        7.4  Fatal Error -- Object File Did Not Open

             This error indicates either a defective listing or object 
        file name or a full disk directory.  Correct the file name or 
        make more room on the disk.


        7.5  Fatal Error -- Error Reading Source File

             This error generally indicates a read error in the disk data 
        space.  Use your backup copy of the source file (You do have one, 
        don't you?) to recreate the mangled file and reassemble.


        7.6  Fatal Error -- Disk or Directory Full

             This one is self-explanatory.  Some more space must be found 
        either by deleting files or by using a disk with more room on it.


        7.7  Fatal Error -- File Stack Overflow

             This error occurs if you exceed the INCLude file limit of 
        four files open simultaneously.  This limit can be increased by 
        increasing the constant FILES in file A51.H and recompiling the 
        cross-assembler.


        7.8  Fatal Error -- If Stack Overflow

             This error occurs if you exceed the nesting limit of 16 IF 
        blocks.  This limit can be increased by increasing the constant 
        IFDEPTH in file A51.H and recompiling the cross-assembler.


        7.9  Fatal Error -- Too Many Symbols

             Congratulations!  You have run out of memory.  The space for 
        the cross-assembler's symbol table is allocated at run-time using 
        the C library function malloc(), so the cross-assembler will use 
        all available memory.  The only solutions to this problem are to 
        lessen the number of labels in the source program or to add more 
        memory.
