HOC3 is an interactive calculator program that, in addition to 
the usual arithmetic operations, does exponentiation, sin, cos,
atan, log, log10, sqrt, and int.  It also contains several built-in
numeric constants: PI, E, GAMMA, DEG, and PHI.  Alphabetic variable
names are also supported.

A sample session with HOC3 follows:

a = 9	  							( user entry)
b = 1								( user entry)
a + b								( user entry)
		10							( HOC evaluates the expression )
4^2
		16
PI
		3.1415926535

sin( PI/2 )
		1

x = PI/2
a = sin(x)
b = cos(x)
a^2 + b^2
		1
