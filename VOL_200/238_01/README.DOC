     GRAD graphics library is a collection of functions for drawing dots, 
lines, circles, ellipsis, arcs and also for region filling, characters 
display, printing ... et cetera. Several useful sample programs such as a 
sideway printing, a graphics and text merge printing and a graphics command 
interpreter are provided. The source listings of sample programs are included
too. All the sample programs are in public domain.

     GRAD supports for CGA (640 X 200) and HGA (720 X 348) graphics mode. 
Other graphics display adapter can be configured too. However, graphics 
display device is not absolutely necessary in GRAD system because up to 9 user 
virtual screen with user definable size can be created at run time.

    The printers supported by GRAD are EPSON FX-80, OKIDATA ML192 or 
compatibles and laser printers using JLASER card. Instructions to configure 
GRAD for other printers are provided too.

    The major difference of GRAD library from other graphics library are its 
superior character display function and versatile printing functions. With 
GRAD library, less than 200 lines of commented coded are required to write a 
sideway printing program with user definable size, font type, spacing, top and 
bottom margins.

     Furthermore GRAD provides very high speed operations. To draw a 
horizontal line of length 300 pixels on a 8MHz, 1 wait state AT, it takes 
about 1 microsecond per pixel on average. The whole library uses integer 
arithmetic only. This ensures high speed operations with or without math
co-processor.

     In order to use GRAD library, you have to configure the GRAD library for 
the display adapter and printer in your system. See INSTALL.DOC on information 
about installation.

     After installation, try out some of the features of GRAD library 
according to the instructions in TEST.DOC.

     The manual for GRAD library and the sample programs can be printed by 
copying the file GRADUSER.DOC to the printing device

        copy GRADUSER.DOC PRN

or use the DOS printer spooler PRINT

        print GRADUSER.DOC
