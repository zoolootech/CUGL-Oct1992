TOUCH

Purpose
set time of files to current time

Syntax
touch [-c] file...

Comments
Touch changes its arguments' date fields in the directory, without
otherwise affecting the files.  If a specified file does not exist and
the -c option has not been specified, touch will attempt to create it
with zero length.  Touch is useful mainly in conjunction with the make
program.  It fools make into thinking that targets which haven't been
changed have been.  For example, if foo.com depends on foo.c, and a
change is made to a comment in foo.c, make will recompile foo.c even
though it doesn't have to.  The command "touch foo.com" will make
foo.com's date later than foo.c's, and thus no needless recompilation
will take place. 

Options
-c      don't try to create file if it doesn't already exist.
