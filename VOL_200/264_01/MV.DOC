MV

Purpose
move files and directories

Syntax
mv [-fiv] [-] file file
mv [-fiv] [-] file... dir
mv [-fiv] [-] dir dir

Comments
Mv moves files and, if to the same disk, directories, from one place to
another.  Mv will simply rename each argument, if possible; if not, it
will copy it and delete the original.  It is possible to trick mv into
destroying a file by moving it onto itself (which rewrites and then
removes it).  However, it guards against incomplete moving of directory
trees to different disks by disallowing it; use the combination of cp -r
and rm -r instead.  The destination can otherwise be a drive specifier,
a directory, or a filename. 

If a file which would be overwritten has the readonly attribute set, mv
prints a warning message and reads a line from the standard input; if
the line does not begin with 'y' or 'Y', the move does not take place.

Options
-       interpret all following arguments as filenames (used to move
        files with names that start with a '-').
-f      force; don't quit if errors are encountered, override any readonly
	attributes, and don't display any error messages.
-i      interactive; ask whether to overwrite existing files.
-v      verbose; display the name of each file as it is moved.
