CAT

Purpose
concatenate files

Syntax
cat [file...]

Comments
Cat can be used both to combine several files and to view files.  The
contents of the specified files are written to the standard output.  If
no files are specified, or when a file named "-" is encountered, the
standard input is used.  If the input is from the keyboard, carriage
returns are added to the newline character at the end of each line.
