RM

Purpose
remove files and directories

Syntax
rm [-fiv] [-] file...
rm [-fiv] -r [-] file|dir...

Comments
Rm allows multiple files, and even whole directories, to be removed
selectively.

Options
-       interpret all following arguments as filenames (used to remove
        files with names that start with a '-').
-f      force; don't quit if errors are encountered in removing files,
	override any readonly attributes, and don't display any error
	messages.
-i      interactive; asks whether to remove each file or directory.
-r      recursively remove arguments which are directories; if not
        specified, arguments which are directories are not removed.
        Note that if you specify both -i and -r, and choose not to
        delete a file which is in a subdirectory, the subdirectory
        itself cannot be removed.
-v	verbose; display the name of each file or directory before
	removing it.
