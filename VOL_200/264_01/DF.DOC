DF

Purpose
display bytes free on disk

Syntax
df [d]

Comments
Df displays the number of bytes free on the specified disk drive, or on
the current drive if none is specified.

Df is a companion to ls, which, unlike the MS-DOS dir command, does not
show the bytes free on the disk since often, on hard disks, determining
the free bytes takes several extra seconds.  Likewise, listing the whole
directory wastes time if you only want to know the free space; thus the
separate commands.
