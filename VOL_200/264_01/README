UNIXPG v1.5 05/22/88

Here are MS-DOS implementations of some Unix programs I had been missing
since starting to use the PC.  Naturally, they're written in C, which
means they compile to larger executables than equivalent assembly language
programs would.  On the flip side, they're easier to change, and I've
included the source code (for Aztec C) in case you want to.

Some of the features of the Unix programs couldn't be duplicated because
of MS-DOS's simpler directory structure, and some features I didn't
think were worth implementing, but most of them are there.  I also added
a few flags here and there.

Known Problems
--------------
Most programs: Pathnames longer than 125 characters overflow the buffers
without any warning.  This should rarely, if ever, cause problems.

cp, mv: Create copies of hidden/system files, but they're zero-length.

mv:
If you do something like
	cd \foo
	mv \foo\bar bar
(moving a file onto itself by specifying two different, equivalent
pathnames), mv will copy the file onto itself (which is harmless) and
then delete it.  With no i-numbers in the directories, that sort of
mistake is hard to check for, so use the -i (interactive query) flag if
you want to be prudent.

Changes In Release 1.3
----------------------
New programs: du, fmt, vis, wc.

Changes to old programs:

ls: "-d" flag removed (didn't work on \).
Command line wildcard expansion is more like Unix's.
Files sorted in columns instead of in rows.

mv: one error message changed.

touch: "-c" flag added; if not specified and argument file doesn't exist,
it is created.

Changes In Release 1.4
----------------------
New programs: tr

Changes In Release 1.5
----------------------
New programs: chmod, df

Changes to old programs:

all except tr: made command-line wildcard parser more modular internally.

cp and mv: increased copy buffer from 1K to 16K (much faster now), set
time of copies to time of originals, "-f" flag added.

fmt: added command-line wildcard parser.  Changed argument parser to
conform to Unix fmt (including undocumented "-#" flag).

ls: moved "total nnn" from bottom of listing to top, and added
directories to the regular listing in recursive lists, like on Unix. 
Finally sorts command line arguments the way Unix ls does.

rm: "-f" and "-v" flags added. 

strings: "-o" flag now shows offset of start of string instead of its
end.

tr: Nulls are now allowed in the range arguments, in the form of octal
escapes, and in the input stream.


If you have any bug fixes or improvements, I'd love to see them.
