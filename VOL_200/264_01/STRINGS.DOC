STRINGS

Purpose
find printable strings in binary files

Syntax
strings [-o$0] [-number] file...

Comments
Strings searches a file for printable ASCII strings, which are
defined as any sequence of 4 of more printable characters ending with a
newline, dollar sign, or null.  Any type of file can be searched, but
using the command on a text file has no obvious purpose.

Options
-o      precede each string by its octal offset in the file.
-$      don't allow '$' as a string terminator.
-0      allow all nonprinting characters as string terminators.
-number use number as the minimum string length instead of 4.
