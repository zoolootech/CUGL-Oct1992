The files on this disk were intended to create the NRO nroff like utility
for MS-DOS. Originally designed for BDS C under CP/M-80, these files were
updated to compile under Microsoft C v4.0 under MD-DOS. These files were
adapted as so to be as portable as possible, however, they were not tested
under any other operating systems or compilers (Caveat emptor).

To create or modify the utility, a make file is included to compile the
files. Type
    A> make nro
to compile the utility. To list any of the manual pages, type
    A> nro -man file
where file is any of nro.nro, man.nro or skeleton.nro. If the user wishes
to create any other manual pages, the file skeleton.nro should be used as
a basis for the new file. The *.doc files are created by redirecting nro
to a disk file. To get "hard copy," either these files can be printed or
the nro command can be used with a redirection to lpt1:, lpt2:, etc. 
(whatever port is your printer).
