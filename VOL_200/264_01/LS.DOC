Comments
Ls provides an informative and versatile display of directories and
files.  It has several output formats.  By default, the entries are
sorted alphabetically by filename; other sortings are available as
options.  In the short (default) listing format the names of
subdirectories are shown followed by a '\'.  Path can be a drive
specifier, a directory, or a filename.
