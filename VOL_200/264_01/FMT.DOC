FMT

Purpose
simple text formatter

Syntax
fmt [-#] [file...]

Comments
Fmt, from the concatenation of the input files, or from the standard
input if no files are specified, produces standard output with each line
as close as possible to the given number of characters wide (default
72).  It preserves blank lines, spaces at the beginnings of lines and
between words, start of paragraph indentations, and dot command lines
(used by many more complex text formatters). 

Fmt is useful for formatting mail messages, and can be used to justify
a paragraph from within vi(1) with the key sequence {!}fmt.

Options
-#      set maximum line width to # (default 72).

Bugs
The carriage return character is treated, perhaps wrongly, as an
ordinary nonwhite character.  Indents longer than the maximum line width
are truncated.  When a sentence-ending character (a period, exclamation
point, question mark, or double quote) occurs at the end of an input
line, fmt adds one space after it, unless the first non-white character
on the next line is a capital letter, in which case two spaces are added
on the assumption that the capital begins a new sentence.  This behavior
is not always correct.  The second lines of paragraphs with the first
line indented and long first lines are indented in the output.
