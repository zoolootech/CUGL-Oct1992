CP

Purpose
copy files and directories

Syntax
cp [-fiv] [-] file file
cp [-fiv] [-] file... dir
cp [-fiv] -r [-] file|dir... dir

Comments
Cp copies files and, recursively, directories, to a single destination,
which can be a drive specifier, a directory, or a filename.  Cp sets the
time and date of the destination files to the same values as on the
original files. 

If a file which would be overwritten has the readonly attribute set, cp
prints a warning message and reads a line from the standard input; if
the line does not begin with 'y' or 'Y', the copy does not take place.

Options
-       interpret all following arguments as filenames (used to copy
        files with names that start with a '-').
-f      force; don't quit if errors are encountered, override any readonly
	attributes, and don't display any error messages.
-i      interactive; ask whether to overwrite existing files.
-r      recursively copy arguments which are directories; if not
        specified, arguments which are directories are not copied.
-v      verbose; display the name of each file as it is copied.
