
This is PC-Gammon Version 6.0.  I hadn't intended to release another public
domain version of this program, but the new io library is so fast I couldn't
help it.

If you're into Microsoft C 4.00, you owe it to yourself to take a look at
the "Bluegrass Functions" in CIAO.LIB.  The backgammon game almost takes a
back seat to these pups.
