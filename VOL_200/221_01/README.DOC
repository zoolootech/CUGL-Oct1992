                     Small C Compiler

*   To use this small C compiler, you should have the            *
*   TSC relocatable assembler, LIB-GEN and linking loader.       *
*                                                                *

The distribution disk(s) contains several files.  First read the
file CC.DOC which contains the documentation of the compiler.

The source code of the C compiler is included. The naming is
cc1.c to cc9.c and cc11.c to cc91.c, also ccdef.c (the definition
of some usefule macroes) and stdio.h (the standart i/o module)
are source files. Another source file is CCPOLL.C a module,
which checks if there was a character entered at the keyboard.

Also the compiled and optimized sources are included. The 
filenames are CC1.ASM to CC9.ASM.

The compiler works on a FLEX system.  It uses the known entry 
points of the operating system.  It should work like it is.
If you want to change the system equates, look in the CCEQU.SYS.
It contains all system dependent equates.

Before starting to build up the compiler, make sure, that you
have a copy of the distribution disk and maybe also off your system
disk if you don't have already one.

To build the compiler use the following command files:

  	- CCASM.COM    (this will assemble all c sources)
  	- CCBUILD.COM  (this will build the C run time library)
  	- CCLOAD.COM   (this will link the compiler)

This procedure will take some time.  I think it's a good idea to drink
in the meantime a cup of coffee.

At the end you should have a runable C Compiler.  If you have for
some reason difficulties, look as mentioned before in the module
CCEQU.SYS, which contains the FLEX system equates for my system.
It may happen, that you have to change some.
