.he            SYSTEM OVERVIEW


Background

      The XDIR system was developed to simplify processing of DOS

      commands  commonly  used,   to  provide  additional   system

      security  and to provide an easier screen presentation  for

      use  by the less knowledgable user.  After it was put  into

      use,   additional  functions  were  added  to  increase  its

      usefulness  and  functionality.  Thus,  what started  as  a

      simple  extended  directory function grew into a number  of

      other functions as well.



Purpose

      The  system is primarily designed to manage the files main

      tained on a personal computer as well as provide some  file

      security capabilities, should that be needed. The system is

      targeted  at  the  more experienced user and  assumes  some

      expertise  in  DOS and knowledge of the  hierarchical  file

      structures of DOS. However, because the system incorporates

      many  help  screens  and  on-screen  prompting,   the  less

      experienced DOS user may also find it helpful.


Functions


      The system provides you with the following capabilities:

           . Delete, Copy or Rename Files
           . Display text files on the screen or list them on the

           printer
           . Dump files in both ASCII and hexadecimal
           . Change file attributes (read-only, hidden, etc.)
           . Encrypt and decrypt files for security purposes
           . Search  for files by date,  attribute and  wildcard

           name
           .  Search  for words in a single file or in a group of

           files within a DOS directory

System Requirements

      IBM PC or compatible with two drives,  128K and DOS 2.0  or

      later.  The  software  requires approximately 30K  of  disk

      space.

.he           USING THE SYSTEM

      This  section  describes in general terms how  to  use  the

      system.  There is a certain amount of information displayed

      on  the screens to assist you as you proceed.  Some screens

      also  provide on-line help.  The system  documentation  may

      also  be  viewed on-line.  In general,  the system is  menu

      driven and available options will be described on  the

      screen, or on an accompanying help screen.

      In this section we will describe the various components  of

      the  system  and  also refer to sample screen  displays  to

      provide  you with an actual sample of the type of  informa

      tion you may expect to see.

Starting up

      From  the  DOS prompt line type the program  name  ("xdir")

      which begins the processing. You may also enter a directory

      name on the command line to begin processing that directory

      directly (such as XDIR 123).  If you enter the word  "HELP"

      on  the  command  line  the help text  file  is  displayed.

      Entering  XDIR without any command line arguments  displays

      the  options available and allows on-line help through  the

      use of the F1 function key.

      Once started,  the system first searches your default  disk

      drive  for the root directory and all subdirectories.  That

      list of subdirectories is then sorted by the full path name

      and the file names of the directories are displayed on  the

      initial  screen.  (See example at figure 1.0 on page  ___).

      Note  that  only the file name is displayed,  not the  full

      path name. For example, a subdirectory named \BIN\JOE\LOTUS

      would be displayed only as LOTUS but would be grouped  with

      all  other  \BIN\JOE and \BIN directories since they  would

      sort together.  The system permits a maximum of 150 direct

      ories,  including the root directory,  to be processed. Re

      maining directories, if any, are ignored.


Initial Screen

      From the initial screen which displays the directory names,

      you  select a directory or sub-directory for  processing  by

      moving  the  cursor to the left of the name of the  desired

      directory and pressing the letter 's' (for select).  If  no

      selections are desired, and you wish to end XDIR processing

      and  return to DOS press the enter key.


      If your default drive contains more than 68 directories  or

      sub-directories,  (68 is the most that will be displayed on

      a  single  screen) you will need to use the PgDn  and  PgUp

      keys  to  go to following or previous screens in the  event

      that  the desired directory is not visible on  the  current

      screen.
 
      If  you  press PgUp or PgDn and there are no  following  or

      previous  screens,  the  system returns to the home  screen

      which  contains  the first 68 directories  in  alphabetical

      order.

.cp 10
      Cursor  movement  is accomplished through the  use  of  the

      arrow  keys and also the Home key which returns you to  the

      upper left hand corner of the screen.   On this screen, the

      only  valid entries are the various arrow keys,  the  PgUp,

      PgDn  F1  (Help) Home and End keys.  Other  characters  are

      ignored by the system.


File Selection Criteria

      Once  you  have selected a directory for processing on  the

      main  menu by entering the letter 'S' next to  the  desired

      directory,  you  are  now  ready to specify  the  selection

      criteria,  since  you may not with to work with all of  the

      files  in the directory at this time.  The names  of  those

      files meeting you search criteria will be displayed and you

      may  optionally   request a list of  the other  information

      (such as file size,  file attributes date and time of  last

      update  etc.).  The system will display a prompting message

      similar to the example shown at figure 2.0 on page x.x.  In

      order to obtain the optional directory list on the  screen,

      answer either 'A', 'D' or 'Y' to the list prompt. If you do

      not  wish  to  specify the file criteria (use  the  default

      which  is all files in the directory) press the escape  key

      (ESC).  The default value (if the enter key is pressed  is

      the alphabetic sequence).


      The list options specified (A,  D or S) determine the  sort

      sequence in which the files will be listed:

           A - Alphabetic by file name
           D - Date sequence in descending order
           S - Sort by file size in ascending order

      The three selection criteria which are provided are:

           . Directory date
           . File name mask
           . File attributes

      In  order to be selected,  a file must meet all the  search

      criteria, which are explained in more detail below:

Directory Date

      Only  those files which have been updated subsequent to the

      date specified will be elgible for selection.  The date  is

      entered in the format YYMMDD without intervening slashes or

      other  punctuation.  The system does no verification  other

      than that six characters have been entered. An invalid date

      is  interpreted as a date of 0 (which then causes all files

      to be elgible for selection).  The default date is 0 or all

      files.

File Name Mask

      This  is  the  same as you would enter  for  the  directory

      searches with the DOS dir command (e.g *.exe for all execu

      table  files  ).  The default entry if  no  information  is

      entered is *.* (all files).

.cp 10
File Attributes

      You may limit your search to files with specific attributes

      :

           r - readonly
           h - hidden
           s - system
           a - archive

      Files  which are labels or directories are not elgible  for

      processing.  Multiple search attributes may be specified by

      entering  them  in combination with no intervening  spaces.

      For  example,  if  you wanted to find all files  which  are

      either  read only or system you would  specify  "rs".  Note

      that  a  file which contains any of the attributes will  be

      selected.


      Once the answers have been provided to the system,  it will

      then search the specified directory and take the  following

      actions:

           .  If no files were found which meet the search crite

           ria  (or  if  the directory were empty) a  message  is

           displayed, and the system returns to the initial menu.

           . The selected files will be sorted by filename

           .  If  the list option was specified  (A,  D  S),  the

           requested directory information will now be displayed.

           (See example in figure 3.0 on page ___.).

           .  An  action screen will be displayed which  contains

           the names of each of the selected files.

           When  all information has been entered,  you will   be

           asked  to  verify the entries by responding  'yes'  or

           'no'  to  the  prompt  asking  if  the  system  should

           proceed.  An  answer of 'n' permits you to revise  the

           action specifications. The default value is 'n'.

           Note:  By  pressing  the escape key in response to  the

           list  prompt,  all  default values are  taken  and  no

           further prompting is performed.

Action Screen

      This is the heart of the system which allows you to specify

      the  action to be taken for each of the selected files,  if

      any.  Once you have indicated the actions to be taken,  the

      system  then displays the file names and the actions to  be

      taken and requests that you verify the actions. See example

      at figure 5.0 on page x.x. If the actions indicated are not

      desired,  you  may  answer no to return to the  screen  and

      specify the actions you do wish. (See example at figure 4.0

      on  page  ____.) Hidden files are  highlighted  in  reverse

      video for easy identification.

.pa 
      The  codes which may be used to specify the actions are  as

      follows:

           X - delete or erase the file
           L - list the file to the printer
           T - type or display the file on the screen
           R - rename the file
           C - copy the file
           D - dump the file in ascii and hexadecimal
           H - hide the file by setting the hidden attribute
           U - unhide a file previously marked as hidden
           P - protect as file from erase by making it readonly
           W - make a file eraseable (opposite of P)
           E - encrypt or decrypt a file
           S - search a file or directory for text

      Cursor movement is done using arrow keys.  In addition, the

      following keys have the following meanings:

           Home  - return  to the upper left hand corner  of  the

           screen
           PgUp - return to the previous screen *
           PgDn - go the following screen       *


      *  These commands are only used when there are more than 68

      selected files in the directory which is the most that XDIR

      will  display  on a single screen.  If these  commands  are

      entered and there is no previous or following  screen,  the

      first screen will be displayed.

      The  meaning  of each of the codes are  described  in  more

      detail below:

           X - delete

           This  code is used to delete or erase a file from  the

           specified  directory.  Before that action is taken,  a

           final verification is done.


           L - list the file to the printer

           This  code  will  cause a listing to be  sent  to  the

           device  "PRN".  The system assumes that all lines  are

           terminated by a carriage return and linefeed, and have

           a length of no more than 80 printable characters.  The

           system  lists 60 lines per page and issues form  feeds

           between pages and at the end of the report.  The first

           page lists the document DOS file name.
.cp 8 
           T - type or display the file to the screen

           The  typing selection allows more than its name  would

           suggest. This selection permits a view of the selected

           text file a page at a time.  Also, specific strings of

           text may be searched.  Because the text is displayed a

           screen  at a time,  you may page back and forth within

           the text.  When you select this option for a file, the

           system  will display the first page of text  and  then

           provide  a prompting liner at the bottom.  The options

           and their meanings are explained on-line using the  F1

           key. Those actions are:

            . PgUp   - disp0lay the previous page
            . PgDn   - display the next page
            . Home   - go to the first page
            . End    - go to the last page
            . Cr     - advance to the next page
            . F1     - display on-line help
            . +nnn   - advance nnn pages or go to the end of the

           document, whichever is closer
            .-nnn    - go backwards nnn pages or to the beginning

           of the document, whichever is closer
            . S      - enter a search string to search beginning

           at  the current page.  If found the page is  displayed

           and the text is highlighted on the screen, otherwise a

           message is displayed and the current page remains
            . ESC    - end further processing


           R - rename the file

           The  system  will  prompt you for the new name  of  the

           file. If you do not wish to change the name, press the

           Enter key.  Otherwise, specify the new name (including

           the path). A file name which does not begin with a '\'

           will be considered to be in the same subdirectory.

           C - copy the file

           The  system will ask the name of the file you wish  to

           copy  this  file to.  If you do not wish to  copy  the

           file,  press enter.  Otherwise,  specify the file name

           (including path). If you wish to copy a group of files

           to  another directory,  enter that subdirectory  name.

           The  system  will then ask if you wish  to  do  "bulk"

           copying.  An  answer of yes results in all  subsequent

           copy  requests to be directed to that  subdirectory.An

           answer of no will copy only that one file and continue

           prompting.  Thus,  if  you wish to combine both single

           and bulk copies,  the single copies must be  specified

           first.

           D - dump the file in ascii and hexadecimal
 
           The file will be dumped in both hex and ascii starting

           at  the  beginning of the file.  Files are  dumped  in

           blocks  of  256 bytes.  The offset of  dump  from  the

           beginning of the file is displayed at the left of each

           line  of the dump in hexadecimal.  Unprintable charac

           ters  (those  with value greater than hex 7f  or  less

           than hex 20 are shown as a decimal point '.'.

           At the bottom of the screen the available options  are

           displayed.  On-line  help is provided with the F1 key.

           The options and their meanings are:

            . PgDn  - display next record
            . PgUp  - display previous record
            . Home  - display the first record
            . End   - display the last record
            . Cr    - display the next record
            . +nnn  - go forward nnn blocks of 256 bytes
            . -nnn  - go backwards nnn blocks of 256 bytes
            . ESC   - end file dump


           H - hide the file by setting the hidden attribute

           This  command causes the DOS directory attribute  byte

           to be set to hidden.  If the file was already  hidden,

           the  command  will be ignored.   The file will not  be

           shown using the DOS dir or type commands nor will DOS

           copy command copy the file. Hidden files are displayed

           on the file selection screen in reverse video.

           U - unhide a file previously marked as hidden

           P - protect as file from erase by making it readonly

           This  command  defines  the file to  be  readonly  and

           therefore  it  may not be erased or deleted except  by

           removing that attribute. If the file was already read

           only,  the  command is ignored.  To delete  the  file,

           first use the 'W' command described below.

           W - make a file eraseable (opposite of P)

           This command is the opposite of the P command above.

           E - encrypt or decrypt a file

           This  command will encrypt or decrypt a file in  order

           that its contents will not be readable except  through

           knowledge of the key. The system will display the name

           of the file be encrypted or decrypted and the ask that

           the  new name and the "key" be provided.  The new name

           is  the name of the encrypted or decrypted  file.  The

           key is a word you must supply in order to restore  the

           readability of the file.  The key used to encrypt

           a file is required to decrypt it.

           A word of caution.  If the key is forgotten,  there is

           no  way to restore the file contents,  and it will  be

           effectively destroyed.

           Example:
           Old file - customer.wk1
           New file - custlist.wk1
           Key      - f123x

           The  existing  file  named customer.wk1  needs  to  be

           secured  from viewing.  Select encryption,  and supply

           the  file name to be encrypted as  "customer.wk1"  and

           the  encryption  key  of  f123x and the  name  of  the

           encrypted file to be "custlist.wk1".  The system  will

           encrypt  the  old file and name the encrypted  version

           custlist.wk1.  The clear text file customer.wk1 should

           be erased and its contents overwritten.  (If not,  the

           file  could be recovered through the Norton  Utilities

           or comparable routine).  To decrypt the file,  use the

           process in reverse,  i.e specify name of existing file

           as   custlist.wk1,   new  file  as  customer.wk1   and

           decryption key as f123x.

        S -Search a single file or a directory for specific text.

           With this command you can locate files which contain a

           specific sequence of text characters.  Included within

           the search text are allowed wild cards (* and ?) which

           work  like the corresponding DOS functions except that

           there  is  no limit to the number  of  characters  for

           which the asterisk may substitute.

           The  search  may be restricted to a single file or  to

           all  files in a directory.  The search may be  further

           limiteted   to  exclude  or  include   specific   file

           extensions such as "COM" or "EXE". The search may also

           ignore upper case, if that is desired.

           The   entry  of  the  information  contains  prompting

           information and on-line is available.

           The  search  text  is entered on  a  sinbgle  line  as

           multiple  words.  The space character is assumed to be

           the  delimiting character.  Special characters may  be

           entered  by  using either the escape sequences  or  by

           specifying  the value of the character in  octal.  For

           example:

                 Entered Character       Interpreted as:

                    \\                      \

File Processing

      Once all options have been selected,  type the Enter key to

      begin  processing.  If no options have been  selected,  you

      will be returned to the main menu.  Otherwise,  the  system

      will  display  the  names  of the  files  to  be  processed

      (including  their  full  path name) and the actions  to  be

      taken  in  words  (such as "will be deleted"  or  "will  be

      encrypted").  After all files have been displayed, the mes

      'y' to take the indicated actions.  The default is no which

      will  return  you  to the selection screen  where  you  may

      revise your selections.

      When  you have finished,  the system will then perform  the

      actions you requested without intervention where  possible.

      However,  the  system will confirm that you wish to  delete

      files. In addition, the system must prompt you for informa

      tion for file copies, renames and encryptions.

      Once  all  processing has been completed,  the system  will

      return  again  to the main list of system  directories  for

      continued processing.
