	Three Dimensional Reconstruction Of Medical
	Images from Serial Slices - CT, MRI, Ultrasound


   These programs process a set of slices images (scans) for one
   patient. It outputs two sets of files containing nine predefined 
   views of bony surfaces. One set contains distance values and 
   the other gradient values.

   The distance values are used as 3-D spatial topographic surface
   coordinate maps for geometrical analysis of the scanned object.

   The gradient values are used for rendering the surface maps on
   CRT displays for subjective viewing where perception of small
   surface details is important.
