NAME
        rz - XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM (Batch) file receive 

                
SYNOPSIS
        rz [-2abuv] [-s<speed>] [-]      (ZMODEM Batch)
        rz [-2abuv] [-s<speed>] [-] -Y   (YMODEM Batch)
        rz [-2abcv] [-s<speed>] file     (XMODEM)
        
DESCRIPTION
        This program uses error correcting protocol to receive  files 
        over  a serial port from a variety of programs running under Unix,
        PC-DOS, CP/M, and other operating systems.  

        Rz (Receive  ZMODEM) receives files with the ZMODEM batch protocol.
        If the sending program does not support ZMODEM, rz steps down to
        YMODEM protocol after 50 seconds. This delay can be eliminated by
        calling the program as rz -Y.

        When receiving with XMODEM or YMODEM, rz accepts either standard
        128 byte sectors or 1024 byte sectors (YAM -k option).  The user
        should determine when the longer block length actually improves
        throughput without causing problems.  

        If extended file information (file length, etc.) is received,
        the file length  controls  the  number  of  bytes written to
        the output dataset (YMODEM only), and the modify time and file
        mode (if non zero) are set accordingly.  

        If no extended file information is received, slashes in the
        pathname are changed to underscore, and any trailing period in the
        pathname is eliminated. This conversion is useful for files received
        from CP/M systems.

        The second form of receives a single with XMODEM protocol. The
        user must supply the file name to both sending and receiving
        programs. rz -X file

        If rz is invoked with stdout and stderr to different datasets,
        Verbose is set to 2, causing frame by frame progress reports
        to stderr. This may be disabled with the q option.  

        The meanings of the available options are: 
        
        2       Use COM2 instead of COM1 (MS-DOS only). By default,
                COM1 is used.
        
        a       Convert files to Unix conventions by stripping carriage
                returns and all characters beginning with the first
                Control Z (CP/M end of file).
        
        b       Binary (tell it like it is) file transfer override. 
        
        c       Request 16 bit CRC. XMODEM file transfers default to 8
                bit checksum. YMODEM and ZMODEM  normally use 16 bit CRC.
        
        p       Protect: skip file if destination file exists.
        
        q       Quiet suppresses verbosity.
        
        t tim   Change timeout to tim tenths of seconds.
        
        v       Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to
                /tmp/rzlog. More v's generate more output.

BUGS
        Pathnames are restricted to 127 characters. In XMODEM single file
        mode, the pathname given on the command line is still processed as
        described above. The ASCII option's CR/LF to NL translation merely
        deletes CR's; undos(omen) performs a more intelligent translation.  

        Non binary file processing consists of stripping all characters
        beginning with CPMEOF (^Z).  
        
FILES        
        /tmp/rzlog stores debugging output generated with -vv option.
