CU(1)                                                                    CU(1)


NAME
        cu - call UNIX

SYNOPSIS
        cu <telno> [-s<speed>] [-l<device>]

DESCRIPTION
        Cu  calls  up  an  UNIX  system,  a  terminal,  or possibly a
        non-UNIX system. It manages an  interactive conversation with
        possible  transfer of  text files.  <telno> is the  telephone
        number, with minus  signs  at  apropriate  places for delays.
        <speed> gives the transmission speed (300, 1200, 2400);  1200
        is the default value.

        The '-l' option may be used to specify 'COM2' serial port.

        Lines entered begining with '~' have special meanings.

        The following are interpreted by the sending part:
        ~.               terminate the conversation.
        ~EOT             terminate the conversation.
        ~<file           send the contents of <file> to the remote
                         system, as though typed at the terminal.
        ~!               invoke an interactive shell on the local
                         system.
        ~!cmd ...        run the command on the local system.
        ~$cmd ...        run the command locally and send its output
                         to the remote system.
        ~%take from [to] copy file 'from' (on the remote system) to
                         file 'to' on the local system. If 'to' is
                         omitted, the 'from' name is used in both
                         places.
        ~%put from [to]  copy file 'from' (on local system) to file
                         'to' on remote system. If 'to' is omitted, the
                         'from' name is used in both places.
        ~~...            send the line '~...'

        The following are interpreted by the receiving part:
        ~>[>][:]file
        zero or more lines to be written to a file
        ~>

        In  any  case, output is diverted (or appended, if '>>' used)
        to the file. If ':' is used, the diversion is silent i.e., it
        is  written  only  to  the file. If ':' is omitted, output is
        written  both  to  the  file  and to the standard output. The
        trailing '~>' terminates the diversion.

        The  use  of '~%put' or '~%take' requires 'stty' and 'cat' on
        the  remote  side.  It  also  requires that the current erase
        character on the remote system be EOT (ASCII 004).
        
        Cursor keys will cause VT-100 escape sequences to be sent. If
        an ANSI  driver is active  (such as ANSI.SYS  or  NANSI.SYS),
        escape sequences  sent by the host will be treated,  giving a
        poor man's VT-100 emulation.


BUGS
        
        Be cautious when sending files with the '~<file' command thru
        a packet switched network. Sometimes characters are lost.
        
        The '~%put' and '~%take' functions have not been tested. Send
        me bug reports!
