NAME
        sz - XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM Batch file Send
        

SYNOPSIS
        sz [-2+aBbdefkLlNnquvYy] [-s<speed>] [-] file ...
        sz [-2+aBbdefkLlNnquvXy] [-s<speed>] [-] file
        sz [-2Beqv] [-s<speed>] -c COMMAND
        
        
DESCRIPTION
        Sz uses the ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM error correcting protocol
        to send one or more files over a serial port to a variety of
        programs running under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix, VMS, and other
        operating systems.  

        The first form of sz sends one or more files with ZMODEM or
        YMODEM batch protocol. Normally, only the file name part of
        the pathname is transmitted. On Unix systems, additional
        information about the file is transmitted. If the receiving
        program uses this information, the transmitted file length
        controls the exact number of bytes written to the output dataset,
        and the modify time and file mode are set accordingly.  

        The a option causes the receiver to convert Unix newlines to
        PC-DOS carriage returns and linefeeds.  

        The second form of uses the flag -X to send a single file with
        XMODEM or XMODEM-1k protocol. The user must supply the file name
        to both sending and receiving programs.  

        The third form sends a single COMMAND to the receiver for execution.
        Sz exits with the COMMAND return value. If COMMAND includes spaces
        or characters special to the shell, it must be quoted.  

        If sz is invoked with stdout and stderr to different datasets,
        Verbose is set to 2, causing frame by frame progress reports to
        stderr.  This may be disabled with the q option. The meanings of
        the available options are:  
        
        +       Instruct the receiver to append transmitted data to an
                existing file (ZMODEM only).
        
        2       Use COM2 instead of COM1 (MS-DOS only). By default,
                COM1 is used. 
        
        a       Convert NL characters in the transmitted file to CR/LF.
                This is done by the sender for XMODEM and YMODEM, by the
                receiver for ZMODEM. 
        
        b       (ZMODEM) Binary override: transfer file without any
                translation.
        
        c COMMAND Send COMMAND to the receiver for execution, return
                with COMMAND's exit status.
        
        d       Change all instances of "." to "/" in the transmitted
                pathname. Thus, C.omenB0000 (which is unacceptable to
                MSDOS or CP/M) is transmitted as C/omenB0000. If the
                resultant filename has more than 8 characters in the stem,
                a "." is inserted to allow a total of eleven.
        
        f       Normally directory prefixes are stripped from the 
                transmitted filename. 
        
        i COMMAND Send COMMAND to the receiver for execution, return
                Immediately upon the receiving program's successful
                reception of the command.
        
        k       (XMODEM/YMODEM) Send files using 1024 byte blocks rather
                than the default 128 byte blocks. 1024 byte packets speed
                file transfers at high bit rates. (ZMODEM streams the data
                for the best possible throughput.) 
        
        L N     Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length N. A larger N 
                (32 <= N <= 1024) gives slightly higher throughput, a
                smaller N speeds error recovery. The default is 128 below
                300 baud, 256 above 300 baud, or 1024 above 2400 baud.
        
        l N     Wait for the receiver to acknowledge correct data every
                (32 <= N <= 1024) characters. This may be used to avoid
                network overrun when XOFF flow control is lacking.
        
        n       (ZMODEM) Send each file if destination file does not exist. 
                Overwrite destination file if source file is newer or longer
                than the destination file.
        
        N       (ZMODEM)  Send each file if destination file does not exist.
                Overwrite destination file if source file has different
                length or date.
        
        o       (ZMODEM) Disable automatic selection of 32 bit CRC.
        
        p       (ZMODEM) Protect existing destination files by skipping
                transfer if the destination file exists.
        
        q       Quiet suppresses verbosity.
        
        r       Resume interrupted file transfer. If the source file is
                longer than the destination file, the transfer commences
                at the offset in the source file that equals the length
                of the destination file.
        
        t tim   Change timeout to tim tenths of seconds.
        
        u       Unlink the file after successful transmission.
        
        v       Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to
                /tmp/szlog. More v's generate more output.  
        
        X       Send a single file with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k protocol. 
        
        Y       Send a single file with YMODEM batch protocol. 
        
        y       Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to overwrite any
                existing file with the same name.

BUGS
        XMODEM transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes per file (1023 bytes
        with XMODEM-k). Most YMODEM programs use the  file length transmitted
        at the beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the correct
        length; this may cause problems with source files that grow during
        the course of the transfer. This problem does not pertain to ZMODEM
        transfers, which preserve the exact file length unconditionally.  

        Most ZMODEM options are merely passed to the receiving program;
        some do not implement all these options.  

        Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window should be used when
        input is from pipes instead of acknowledging frames each 1024 bytes.

        If no files can be opened, sz sends a ZMODEM command to echo a
        suitable complaint; perhaps it should check for the presence of
        at least one accessible file before getting hot and bothered.
        The test mode leaves a zero length file on the receiving system.  

        Some high speed modems have a firmware bug that drops characters
        when the direction of high speed transmissson is reversed.
        The environment variable  ZNULLS may be used to specify the number
        of nulls to send before a ZDATA frame. Values of 101 for a 4.77 mHz
        PC and 124 for an AT are typical.  

        Some versions of Unix cu(1) do not operate properly with this program.
