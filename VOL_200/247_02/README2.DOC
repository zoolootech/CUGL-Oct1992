  SAMPLE.CPP  -     Example C++ source (uses FLASH.HPP)

  If using Microsoft C Version 5.0+ or Turbo C V1.0+ then rename MS5S.LIB
  or TCS.LIB to MIRACL.LIB and you're in business right away. If using
  another compiler then you must execute the appropriate xxDOIT.BAT file
  to create the MIRACL library.

  Some files on this disk implement an experimental C++ implementation of
  the MIRACL library. All the extra work is done by the headers "big.hpp",
  "flash.hpp" and "number.hpp". This system was developed using ZORTECH C++
  Version 1.0, which is VERY buggy and unhelpful.

  The standard MIRACL library must first be re-compiled using the ZORTECH
  compiler. See zpdoit.bat 

  Note how readable the C++ versions of the example programs now look.
