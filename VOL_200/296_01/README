This disk contains the C to C++ Migrator program ctocxx.exe
and a pair of .bat files to run it. The ctocpp.bat file calls
ctocpp1.bat.  The MKS sed stream editor must be available or
the final editing cannot be done. A small sampl.c program that
does nothing but exhibits various function declaration styles
is the sample input. 

Usage: ctocpp sampl.c

This invokes the Microsoft C compiler with the /E option.
The preprocessed source file will then be fed to ctocxx.exe.
This version of ctocxx does not echo the input, if a syntax
error occurs it reports the line number and column and quits.
The output of ctocxx.exe is two files,
proto.out and ed.out. The ed.out file is used by the sed
stream editor to edit the original source file. The proto.out
file is used in header files as required.


The sampl.sed file is what the sampl.c becomes after editing.

This disk also contains the article and the source files to
be listed with the article. The source files have been stripped
tabs, all indenting is by spaces. EXAMPLE is a combined listing
of the sampl.c input, the outputs and the result after sed edits
the original source file. It is the first referenced listing
in the article.

The full grammar is gram.y ( over 400 lines ) which may be too
much to use in the magazine. I have provided little.y which
includes mainly just the productions that the migrator has
code attached to. I left the tabs in the grammar.

The other source files are ctocxx.l, subs.c, ctocxx.c and the
header ctocxx.h. Yacc makes ytab.h when it runs but I have
included it on the disk. The ctocxx file is a makefile for
Microsoft C 5.1. The ctocpp.bat and ctocpp1.bat comprise a
DOS batch file for running the migrator.

I have copied the flex executables into the flex directory.
You must have MKS yacc and sed to build and run the program.

The article needs one figure which is not on the disk.
