     Basically  these  programs  (except for  the  already  compiled 
KITTYLNT.COM) are self-documented.  That is,  they contain extensive 
comments imbedded in the source code, as well as long introductions.
     KITTYLNT.C   and  KITTYLNT.C88  are  very  slightly   different 
versions  of the same program.  KITTYLNT.C compiles,  as  is,  under 
Aztec  C  II  v1.06D  and runs on my Kaypro  2X  running  CP/M  2.2. 
KITTYLNT.C88 is the same program, modified to compile under Eco-C88. 
It  compiles  as  is,  and runs on my SWP Co-Power  Plus.  (An  8088 
coprocessor board running MS-DOS.)
     The program is a poor-man's "lint" program. It looks for errors 
in  C  source code.  And it finds plenty of  them  for  me,  perhaps 
because I am a careless typist.
     It  is good at finding unbalanced brackets and  quotes.  Pretty 
good  at checking for semicolons at the ends of lines,  and checking 
to  see  that  "for" loops have the right number  of  arguments  and 
printf() statements have the same number of conversion arguments  as 
conversion  characters.  It  makes a brave stab at checking to  make 
sure that function declarations don't have a semicolon after then.
     It cannot find such things as type inconsistencies,  undeclared 
variables,  or  wrong  number of arguments  in  function  calls.  It 
generates some spurious errors, and misses some errors. But it still 
saves me lots of programming time. I am rather pleased with it.uch things as type inconsistencies,  undeclared
