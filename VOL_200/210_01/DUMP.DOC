                A memory HEX/ASCII Dump program by K.G.Busch
                --------------------------------------------

        Dump.C a 'C' language utility was written, as was this DOC file on
    the Mix Split Screen Text Editor. The Mix 'C' Compiler and Linker were
    also used to compile and link the program by K.G.Busch in Oct 1986.
        All were done on the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 4 with the Montezuma
    Micro CP/M 2.2 operating system. For those who intend to rewrite this
    utility for another system or compiler, the peek function used in my
    hlook and alook functions is a non-standard function. Beyond that one
    discrepancy it should be a very easy task to rewrite and improve this
    utility for use with another system or for other purposes.
        The program essentially consists of two nested DO WHILE loops, a
    FOR loop and four functions written by me.
        The first of the four functions is the head() function that prints
    out the headers for the memory address columns and sixteen low byte
    addresses.
        The border() function prints a double line separator, composed of
    equal characters, between the header line and the lines of memory data
    that are in HEX format.
        The hlook() function extracts the bytes of data from sixteen
    sequential memory addresses and prints the information out in a HEXA-
    DECIMAL format.
        The alook() function extracts the same sixteen bytes as the hlook()
    function and checks to see if they are printable characters. If the
    bytes of data are printable they are then printed, otherwise a period
    is substituted for non-printable characters.
        The first input is for the location address in memory to start
    looking at data. This address must be in the HEXADECIMAL format. The
    subsequent inputs are a <ENTER> key to read the next page of data,
    consisting of two hundred fifty six bytes of data or another key and
    the <ENTER> key. The later will return you to the HEX address input
    request. A control 'C' will exit the program and return control to the
    CP/M operating system.
        There are two COM files, DUMP.COM and DUMPS.COM. Both are from the
    DUMP.C file, however the DUMP.COM file was linked with the RUNTIME.OVY
    and the DUMPS.COM was linked with the SMALLCOM.OVY. Neither file has
    had the SPEED UTILITY or the SHRINK UTILITY applied to them and each
    will perform in an identical manner.
        I would appreciate receiving printed copies of any 'C' source
    improvements that may be made.
