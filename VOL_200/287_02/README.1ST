GRAD graphics library can only be executed on IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible 
machines and it requires Microsoft C version 4.0 or Turbo C version 1.0
and the programs must be compiled in small model.

You may get the latest version of GRAD library including the source of the 
sample programs and executable version of the programs for HGA or CGA and
EPSON FX-80 or OKIDATA ML192 by sending $15 to the address below.

Source listings and programmer's reference manual (including hints on porting 
to other machines) are available by sending a contribution of $60 or more. The 
source file contains 3218 lines of C codes and 2760 lines of 8088 assembly 
codes. C equivalent routines of some of the assembly routines are included 
with the source listing to facilitate understanding of the assembly routine 
and porting to other machines.

You may type the following commands to extract the files from the archive 
files. (README.DOC exists in both GRAD12MS.ARC and GRADINTR.ARC but they are 
the same) Note : the sequence is important.

        pkxarc gradintr
        pkxarc /r grad12ms
        pkxarc graduser
        pkxarc gradfon

If you use Turbo C version 1.0, you should extract the files from GRAD12TS.ARC 
also.
        pkxarc /r grad12ts

You should extract files from archive files inside GRAD12MS and GRAD12TS 
only when the documentation instructs you to do so.

To extract the files inside a archive file, type

        pkxarc filename

Executable files of the sample programs for different display adapter and 
printer driver is available by sending $10 to the address below:

        Mr. Conrad Kwok
        9228 Vancouver Dr.
        Sacramento, CA 95826

Please specify the display adapter you have (either CGA or HGA) and the 
printer driver required (either EPSON FX-80 or OKIDATA ML192).

Now, you should read the files in GRADINTR.ARC first.

For Microsoft C user, you should read
        read.me
        install.doc
        graduser.doc

For Turbo C user, you should read
        read.me
        tc-inst.doc
        tc-user.upd
        graduser.doc
