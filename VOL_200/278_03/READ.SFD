This tool is intended to be a supplement to your CXL library and 
to help you design screens and forms that are completely compatible 
with this library, regardless of the compiler or memory model you 
are using. The program will generate C code you can use in your own
program (a file that will automatically be given a .C extension), and
an environment file (which will automatically be given an .ENV
extension) which can be loaded again for editing.
 
SFD can be started with several switches as follows:

     SFD [-switches] [-f<filename>]
          -c       To eliminate CGA snow
          -m       To force monochrome attributes
          -b       To use BIOS

     <filename> is the full name of the environment file you wish to
     load. Please notice that the -f switch must be the last switch on
     the command line. All switches after that will be ignored.

If you forget these switches just type "SFD ?" and you will see them
again.

The program is so easy and intuitive that it does not need any
explanations. The only assumption made is that you are familiar with
the CXL library. If you find this utility useful, please use the form
at the end of this file to register. This will help me spend more time
improving it and will entitle you to future versions at special
discount prices. 
 
Following is the menu hierarchy of SFD and some brief notes, where 
necessary. 
 
Initially, you can use arrows to move around the screen. Once you 
have windows (as many as your memory allows) you can navigate 
through windows using PgUp and PgDn. 
 
WINDOW -  CREATE    Makes a 1x1 window at current cursor location. 
          RESIZE 
          MOVE 
          SHADOW    Provides shadow in the color of your choice. 
          DELETE 
 
COLOR -   WINDOW 
          BORDER 
 
BORDER -  TYPE 
          COLOR 
 
TITLE -   TEXT      Make sure your title text is not wider than 
                    your window; otherwise, it will just be 
                    truncated. 
          COLOR 
 
SCRIPT              Allows you to add static text to any window in 
                    ANY color you want. Once you are finished, this 
                    text will be saved in a file that will later 
                    be loaded by your program. Use this option to 
                    design the static parts of your forms. 
 
FIELD     ADD       It is assumed that you are familiar with the field
                    definition parameters of the CXL library. If 
                    not, please refer to the CXL manual. The only 
                    new thing you have to define here is the "Type" 
                    of the field, which can be "S" for strings of 
                    any length (1 for character), "M" for mixed 
                    upper and lower strings, "N" for numeric and 
                    "D" for date. These will just make the rest 
                    of definitions easier. 
          EDIT 
          COLOR   SELECTED
                  UNSELECTED
                        
 
PROGRAM            This is the heart of the system. It generates code
                   which you can mix into your program and it
                   automatically creates an environment file (with the
                   same name and an .ENV extension) that can later be
                   loaded and edited.
