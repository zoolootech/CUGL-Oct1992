                                ABSTRACT

The Check Register Program simplifies the task of maintaining one or
more checking accounts.  Three separate programs are included:

     CHECKS    The primary application, manages the current check
               register, including reconciliation of transactions which
               have cleared the bank.

     CLEARS    Maintains and summarizes transactions after they have
               cleared the bank, for historical review.

     CHECKSIN  Installs the CHECKS.SCR file, adapting CHECKS and CLEARS
               to your particular video display terminal or computer
               console.

Sample data files are included for tutorial and demonstration purposes.
Commented C language source files are provided in lieu of further
support.


                                FEATURES

As you will surely admit, managing a checkbook by hand is fairly simple;
therefore, one of the primary design goals for this program was to make
using it at least as easy as the manual method.  This has been
accomplished by implementing the following features:

  o  The user interface is modeled after WordStar.  If you use WordStar,
     you already know how to move the cursor, scroll pages, and edit
     text.  If you are not familiar with WordStar, a convenient "help"
     screen is readily available.

  o  Transaction date (month, day, and year) will default to that of the
     previous entry.  Only changes need to be typed.  If you are
     entering several transactions for the same month and year, only the
     day might require revision.

  o  You may define abreviations for accounts that are paid repeatedly,
     such as gas, electric, water, and telephone utilities, revolving
     charge accounts, and supermarkets.  When an abreviation is entered,
     the payee description will automatically expand to the full name
     you have linked to the abreviation.

  o  Each entry may be assigned a category.  You may define your own
     categories by use of a single character.  For example, you may use
     H for household transactions and T for tax deductible entries.
     Also, categories may be conveniently utilized to manage two or more
     checkbooks within one account.

  o  Extended integer arithmetic is used to keep track of amounts
     ranging from -3,276,899.99 thru +3,276,799.99 without losing any
     pennies.

  o  A simple calculator may be used to add to or subtract from the
     amount field of each entry.  A memory register is included, which
     is retained each time the program is executed.

  o  Automatic transactions may be defined.  Examples include a monthly
     loan payment which is automatically withdrawn from your account on
     a certain day, or your salary which is automatically transferred
     from your employer's bank to your account.

  o  Entries may be conveniently sorted to primary and secondary levels,
     including date and payee, payee and date, category and date, or
     amount and date.

  o  A reconciliation report itemizes checks, deposits, and current
     balance for entries which have cleared the bank and for all entries
     by category, including a total over all categories.

  o  Cleared entries are removed to a separate file, retaining only
     active transactions in the check register.  An independent program
     is provided to manage cleared entries.

  o  The current check register, the reconciliation report, and an audit
     trail of cleared entries may be printed for filing and backup.

  o  An installation program will quickly adapt the program to work with
     your video display terminal or computer console.


                              REQUIREMENTS

The Check Register Program requires an 80 column x 24 row video display
with addressable cursor.  Various terminals and computer consoles are
supported.  The CP/M-80 operating system and one disk drive are
necessary.  An 80 column printer with FORM FEED control is desirable.

For a single check register, the database of transactions is maintained
in two separate files, one for those which have not cleared the bank and
another for those which have.  The maximum number of active (uncleared)
entries is 128, which is generally sufficient for a very large family or
a very small business, assuming bank statements are received monthly.
Up to 384 cleared entries are kept in the database; for an average
family, this should be sufficient for about six months.  When the 384
limit is approached, older records may be marked for summary and
removal; each summary is retained in the database.  The program may be
used to manage more than one check register by defining separate sets of
database files.

The Check Register Program was developed using WordStar, BDS C, and an
Osborne 1 59K CP/M 2.2 system with 52.5K transient program area (TPA).
