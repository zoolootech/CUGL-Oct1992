LBR Distribution Library

The Check Register Program simplifies the task of managing one or more
checking accounts.  Because of its size, the program was originally
provided as two separate library files named CHX8010A.LBR and
CHX8010B.LBR.  The filenames were derived from the following:

You may find it convenient to evaluate the A library first, to determine
whether the program will satisfy your needs.

An appropriate public domain (PD) program such as LU, NULU, or LSWEEP
may be used to extract files from each LBR distribution library.  Any
which are squeezed (have a Q as the second letter of the file type, as
in FILENAME.TQP) should be unsqueezed using a PD program like USQ or
NSWEEP.

The CHECKS.DOC file should be printed for your use.  Do not use a
formatting print routine such as WordStar's Print function.  CHECKS.DOC
has already been formatted, so that page numbers will be consistent with
the Table of Contents.  It may be conveniently printed using the CP/M
PIP utility.  Place PIP.COM and CHECKS.DOC in drive A.  At the A>
prompt, type

     PIP LST:=CHECKS.DOC

after first making sure that your printer is set for 66 lines per page
(11 inch page at 6 lines per inch) and 80 columns per line, loaded with
continuous fan-fold paper, and positioned with the print-head at top-of-
page.

Once all necessary files have been extracted and unsqueezed, store the
original LBR distribution disk in a safe place as a backup.  That disk
should be used if you wish to make a copy for a friend.

CHECKS.SCR File and CHECKSIN Program

The Check Register Program utilizes the screen parameter file CHECKS.SCR
to identify cursor controls which are compatible with your video display
terminal or computer console.  A copy of CHECKS.SCR is included in the
distribution library.  Contrary to the documentation, this copy has
already been installed for an Osborne 1/Executive/Vixen computer.

If you do not have an Osborne computer, the CHECKSIN program will
automatically adapt CHECKS.SCR to work properly with your equipment.
Place CHECKSIN.COM, CHECKSIN.DAT, and CHECKS.SCR on a single disk in
drive A.  You should leave about 2 KB free space on the disk.  Do not
remove this disk until the installation process is complete.  At the A>
prompt, type

     CHECKSIN

Additional instructions will be displayed by the program, or read
CHECKS.DOC for further details.


                         EXECUTING the PROGRAM

The Check Register Program requires that CHECKS.SCR reside in the
default disk drive (indicated as part of the > prompt).  When the
program is started, it will look for an information file of type INF and
a database file of type DAT, which need not be on the same disk as the
COM or SCR files.  When the program is stopped using ^KD, it will add
any cleared entries to a file of type CLR, rename the original DAT file
to be of type BAK, and write the current active register to a new DAT
file.  The INF, DAT, CLR, and BAK files will all be on the same disk and
will all have the same filename; the default filename is CHECKS, but you
may choose another name.  In this way, you may manage more than one
check register by giving each a different name.

On the command line, you may indicate which check register to use.  For
example, if you wish to work with the demonstration files provided in
the distribution library, place a copy of DEMO.DAT and DEMO.INF in drive
A along with CHECKS.COM and CHECKS.SCR.  At the A> prompt type

     CHECKS DEMO

Press ^J (CONTROL and J simultaneously) for a brief "help" screen, then
try to find your way around the demonstration.

In general, the command line may be typed as

     u>v:CHECKS w:filename

where u represents the default disk drive containing CHECKS.SCR, v
indicates the drive where CHECKS.COM is located, and the register files
may be found on drive w with the name "filename".  If v: is not
specified, the COM and SCR files will be assumed on default drive u.
Similarly, if w: is not included, register files will be read and
written on the default drive.  Finally, if "filename" is blank, the
default name CHECKS will be assumed.

The CLEARS program is initiated in a similar manner.  CHECKS.SCR must be
on the default disk.  CLEARS will read the filename.INF and filename.CLR
files and write a new filename.CLR file; DAT and BAK files are not
involved with the CLEARS program.  The general command line is

     u>v:CLEARS w:filename

where the default "filename" is CHECKS.


                            GETTING STARTED

The simplest way to begin a new check register is to place CHECKS.COM,
CLEARS.COM, and CHECKS.SCR (installed for your screen) on a disk in
drive A.  At the A> prompt, type

     CHECKS

The program will indicate that CHECKS.INF and CHECKS.DAT are not
available, but you should choose to continue.  You will then be
presented with an empty register.

Find the oldest uncleared entry in your previous paper check register.
Determine the account balance which existed prior to that transaction,
and enter the balance amount into the new register as a deposit (DEP).
Call that entry something like "Current Balance", and mark it cleared
(CLR).  Then proceed to transfer all remaining transactions from your
previous register to your new register, marking them CLR if appropriate.
When completed, you may wish to order (^KO) and/or print (^KP) the
result.  Finally, use ^KD to quit the program.

You should observe that CHECKS.DAT and CHECKS.CLR have been added to
drive B.  You may wish to investigate these files by restarting CHECKS
or by executing CLEARS (in the same manner as CHECKS).

You may wish to create a companion information file with the default
name CHECKS.INF.  Use a familiar ASCII text editor such as ED or
WordStar (Non-document mode) as described in CHECKS.DOC.  Define any
automatic transactions, which might include salary deposits, mortgage
payments, or checking account fees.  Add abreviations for utility
companies, loan companies, credit cards, supermarkets, etc.  Then
compose a title for your personalized register.
