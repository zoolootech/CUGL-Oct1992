WHAT IS BISON?

    Bison generates a table driven parser written in 'C' code from
    a grammar specification.  It is upward compatible with Bell
    Laboratories YACC.

WHAT DO I NEED IN ORDER TO USE IT?

    Three files are required:

        BISON.EXE,          ( the executable file )
        SIMPLE.PRS,         ( template for simple, non-reentrant parser )
        HAIRY.PRS           ( template for reentrant parser )

    They may all be in the same subdirectory, or the parser templates,
    SIMPLE.PRS and HAIRY.PRS, may be located elsewhere. In the latter
    case, you must specify their full path/filename in the  environment
    variables BISON_SIMPLE and BISON_HAIRY.  Using only the subdirectory
    path is insufficient.

    EXAMPLE:

        If SIMPLE.PRS is located in C:\usr\tools\bin,
        then you must issue the DOS command:

            set bison_simple=c:\usr\tools\bin\simple.prs
