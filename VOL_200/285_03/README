This directory contains the Bison parser generator.

When installing Bison on Sequent (or Pyramid?) systems, you must
be in the Berkeley universe.

On systems that do not have a working `alloca' function, you will
have to get a working `alloca' (perhaps from GNU Emacs) and edit the
Makefile so that it will be used.

On system V, you will need to alter symtab.c to include string.h,
and probably add a definition of bcopy in conflicts.c:

			#define bcopy(src,dst,n) memcpy(dst,src,n)
