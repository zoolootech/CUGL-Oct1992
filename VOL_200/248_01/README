DESCRIPTION:

	MicroSPELL is a stand alone spell checker which scans text files
and reports on misspelled words.  It has a 1000 word common word list
and a 43,000 word main dictionary.  Multiple user dictionaries can also
be used during a spell check.

	MicroSPELL will run on any MSDOS machine, on AMIGA 1000s, Atari
STs, several different flavors of UNIX and on the IBM 370 series
mainframe under CMS. 

	This can also be used in conjunction with a MicroEMACS 3.9 macro
(scan.cmd) which steps through the source file, stopping at each suspect
word and allowing the user to dispose of it in different ways.  (An
XEDIT script on the IBM 370 will be availible in September 87 to do this
as well). 

	There are two stand alone utilities that are used to maintaine
the dictionary.  DMERGE will merge a text file of words and the main
compressed dictionary into a new text dictionary.  CDICT will take a
text dectionary and create a new compressed dictionary.

DOCUMENTATION:

	There is not much right now.  There will be more later.  Check
the spell.txt file for a quick summary of how to use SPELL. 

INSTALLATION:

	The various files need to be somewhere in the executable path on
machines that have paths.  On machines which don't, the files need to be
placed in a directory listed in the DPATH.H file.  Once all the files
are there, they should work without other problems. 

	On the ATARI ST, make sure to install spell.prg as a TOS TAKES
PARAMETERS application via the install application menu entery from the
GEM desktop.  On the AMIGA, spell is best invoked from the CLI command
line.

SUPPORT:

	I will support these programs, and encourage everyone to spread
them around as much as they can.  If you make what you think are changes
that are useful to many, send me the updates, and as time permits, I
will incorporate the ones I understand, and agree with into the master
sources.  Being overwhelmed with mailers, I have discontinued my mailing
offer, but if you have a special problem getting hold of MicroSPELL,
contact me and we can work something out for you.
