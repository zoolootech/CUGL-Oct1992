NAME
	GETSYS.HEX	Utility to extract CP/M

SYNOPSIS
	i8080 -b getsys.hex -A .  -B cpm20.com

DESCRIPTION
	GETSYS extracts CP/M operating system from a standard CP/M master
	floppy disk.
	
	The parameter of -A option must be . because the source disk drive 
	always is physical. The parameter of the -B option can be any file name.
	However, the use of a file name, "cpm20.com" is recommended.

	You need to create "cpm20.com" before executing GETSYS.
	For example, on MS-DOS, you can use the command
		type null > cpm20.com
	to create a new empty file, "cpm20.com"

	Since GETSYS assumes that BIOS of I8080 handles the standard CP/M
	6 sectors skew scheme, the program translates the sector number when 
	reading a physical disk in order to compensate for the skew.


WARNINGS
	The filename specified with -B option must exist before the execution
	of the program.
	If the size of the file is over 8 Kbytes, the extra information will
	still be kept.
	GETSYS will not do any error checking during the execution.
