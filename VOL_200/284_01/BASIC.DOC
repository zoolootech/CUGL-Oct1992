NAME
	BASIC.HEX	BASIC interpreter (stand alone)

SYNOPSIS
	i8080 -b basic.hex

DESCRIPTION
	"Palo Alto Tiny BASIC" is ported to I8080. The screen input and output
	are performed using BIOS handling facility of I8080.
	The virtual disk can't be accessed in this BASIC.

	The end-of-line character, erase character, line-erase character,
	interrupt character and end-of-file character are mapped into Cntl-M 
	(Return), Cntl-H, Cntl-X, Cntl-C, and Cntl-Z respectively.
	The explanation of interpreter and BASIC is omitted here, so 
	please refer to some other literature.

	This program is intended for demonstration rather than practical
	purpose. This program emphasizes the speed and memory size of an
	actual 8080 processor. Therefore, it sacrifices the readability of
	the code. Indeed, BASIC.HEX works well under I8080 without 
	making any changes but in I/O routines.

	Please enjoy the special programming technique on the days
	when hardware was expensive and not as sophisticated as one these days.

BUGS
	You cannot save a file including BASIC code.
	The only available memory is about 3 Kbytes.
