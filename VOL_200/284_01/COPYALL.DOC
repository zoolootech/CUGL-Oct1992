NAME
	COPYALL.HEX	Utility to copy virtual CP/M disks

SYNOPSIS
	i8080 -b copyall.hex -A from -B to

DESCRIPTION
	COPYALL, a stand alone program, works under I8080 and copies
	virtual disks. A source disk is replaced with "from" and 
	a destination disk is replaced with "to" in the command line.
	After the execution, it terminates I8080.

	When copying files between virtual disks, you could use a copy utility
	supplied by the operating system. However, COPYALL can copy 
	files between virtual and physical disks.

	The advantage over the PIP program is the execution speed and that it 
	doesn't require CP/M for the execution. 
	The disadvantage of the program is that the size of the virtual disk
	reaches the maximum size no matter how many files are included in
	the disk.

WARNINGS
	No error checking is performed during the execution.
	You can't terminate the program until it finishes.
