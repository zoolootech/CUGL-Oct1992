NAME
	MKHEX.EXE	Creation of CP/M boot file

SYNOPSIS
	mkhex nn

DESCRIPTION
	MKHEX creates a CP/M boot image file that is used in I8080.
	nn is specified in decimal and stands for the system size of CP/M.

	When a program starts, it reads BIOSnn.HEX and CPMnn.COM in the
	current directory in the current disk drive and creates CPMnn.HEX.
	BIOSnn.HEX is an Intel hexa format created by assembling BIOS. 
	CPMnn.COM must be a file that includes CP/M system.

	As for the porting of CP/M, please refer to "porting.doc".

WARNINGS
	No error checking is performed. For example, no warning is displayed
	when the system size specified in the command line is different from
	one in the BIOS module. However, even when booted in I8080, the program
	will not work correctly.
