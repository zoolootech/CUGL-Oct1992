[READ-ME.070]

Wellcome to the PORTABLE 8080 system.

This package is designed to run a CP/M-80 system under non-8080
micros.  Main part of the package is an interpreter of 8080
machine codes, which is written in C language with portable
codings.  I tested my program on some different machines
including an MS-DOS personal computer and a unix workstation.
I believe that you can port the program to many machines without
much troubles. Current version is configured for Borland's Turbo
C 1.5.

CP/M itself is not included in the package, because it is not
public domained, and its copyrights are held by Digital
Research.  You have to construct your CP/M system by yourself.
I wrote some tools to support porting CP/M, which are included
in the package.  I also put ready-to-use CP/M BIOS in it.  Your
job will not be so hard.

Some stand-alone programs are also included, which run on
the portable 8080 system without CP/M.  They include a famous
Palo Alto Tiny BASIC.  It demonstrates the power of our 8080
interpreter to execute tricky self-rewriting codes.

This package contains the following programs.  Their sources
are also included.  Note that all files with extention '.ASM' in
the package are CP/M ASM sources for 8080 and '.COM' are CP/M
commands.

i8080.exe	a portable 8080
cpmfile.exe	access virtual CP/M disks
newdsk.exe	initialize virtual CP/M disks
mkhex.exe	create CP/M boot image file (CPMxx.HEX)

bios20.hex	assembled 20KB BIOS

getsys.hex	a stand-alone utility to extract CP/M system
copyall.hex	a stand-alone utility to copy virtual CP/M disks
basic.hex	a stand-alone BASIC (famous Palo Alto version)

halt.com	a vertual CP/M command to exit to host OS
