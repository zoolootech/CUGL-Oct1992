NAME
	NEWDSK.EXE	Initialization of virtual disks

SYNOPSIS
	newdsk file ...

DESCRIPTION
	NEWDSK creates and initializes a virtual disk file for I8080.
	More than one file can be specified in the command line.
	If the specified file doesn't exist, it creates a new file, 
	otherwise, it erases the contents of the file.

	Although the virtual disk that NEWDSK has created has only 2 Kbytes 
	at the beginning, the size will increase as CP/M files are created in
	the virtual disk (240Kbytes, at most).
