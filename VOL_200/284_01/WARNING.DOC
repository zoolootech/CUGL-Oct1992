WARNINGS:

The phisical disk access routine of destributed version of exe-
cutable file 'I8080.EXE' is run on NEC PC-9801 series only.  You
must re-write some functions in the file BIOS.C and compile it
to use phisical disk access facility on other machines.  You can
run destributed version of I8080.EXE on any MS-DOS machines if
you do not use phisical disk.

The file BIOS.C is not portable.  You will have to re-write it
if you port the program to other machines and/or operating sys-
tems.  Even under MS-DOS, some changes are necessary if you use
other compiler.  Destributed version is compiled with Turbo C
version 1.5J. (a Japanese version by S.P.L.)
