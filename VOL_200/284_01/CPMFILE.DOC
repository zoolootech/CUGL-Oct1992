NAME
	CPMFILE.EXE  CP/M virtual disk access

SYNOPSIS
	cpmfile [-webvl] [-d disk] [-u user] [-o file] file ...

DESCRIPTION

	Please set options as described below:

	When more than one character flag (webvl) is used, please 
	attach a dash for each option. 

	When the option that requires a parameter is used, it doesn't
	matter whether or not there is a space between the option and 
	parameter.

	Although the option can be specified in any order, a file name
	must come after options.

	Some combinations of options are restricted. Please refer to the
	detail below where each option is described.

w	The program writes a file to the virtual disk. If none of w, e, or l 
	options	is specified, the program reads a file from the virtual disk.
	When w is specified but e is not specified, a file that will be
	written to the disk shouldn't exist in the virtual disk. If it does,
	an error will occur. When both w and e are specified and a file
	that will be written exists in the disk, the file will be removed
	before the operation. The w option can't be used with l or o options.

	When a file is written with this option, the CP/M filename
	in the virtual disk and the filename under MSDOS will be the same. 
	Therefore, the file under MSDOS should be in the current directory
	in the current disk.

e	The program erases a file in a virtual disk. When w is not
	specified with this option, the file will be erased from the disk.
	When w is specifed with this option, the file will be created after
	it is erased. The e option can't be used with l or o options.

l	The program displays filenames in a virtual disk. The l option
	can't be used with w,e, or o options. It can be used with a v option,
	but it makes no difference whether it is with a v option or without it.

	The program checks if the specified file exists in the disk and
	displays the only filenames that exist in the disk. A wildcard
	can't be used. Normally, one or more than one file has to be specified,
	but if no filename is specified the program will display all 
	filenames with the specified user number in the disk.

v	The program displays currently processing filenames. No filename
	is displayed in default. In the command line of COMPFILE, it is
	possible to specify more than one filename and execute them with
	options. With this option, a filename processed currently is displayed.

b	The program treats a file as a binary file. In default, a file 
	is treated as a text file.

	Without this option when reading and writing a file, the file will be
	treated as a text file and  transformed. The transformation is 
	performed between the file format of the host operating system and
	the CP/M file format. This feature is designed so that the contents
	of a file would be same between operating systems that have
	different file formats, e.g. UNIX or MVS and CP/M.
	When the host operating system is MSDOS, the transformation described 
	below is performed (although MSDOS and CP/M file foramt are same.)

	When the program reads a file from the virtual disk, it searches
	for the end-of-file character, 1AH. When it finds the character,
	the reading of the file terminates. As a result, MSDOS file doesn't
	include 1AH.

	When the program writes a file to the virtual disk, it searches for
	the end-of-file character (1AH). When it encounters the character,
	the program acknowledges the end of the file and appends 1AHs until
	the size of the file is a multiple of 128.

	When reading or writing a file with the b option, the processed file
	will be treated as a binary file. In both reading and writing 
	operations, the size of the file is the same. The size of the MSDOS 
	file read from the virtual disk is always a multiple of 128. Writing 
	a file, when the size of MSDOS file is a multiple of 128, creates a 
	CP/M file with the same size. However, when the file is not currently
	a multiple of 128, binary 0s are appended until the file size becomes 
	a multiple of 128.

o	This options specifies a MSDOS filename read from the virtual disk.
	In default, the same filename as one that is read will be used.
	The o option can't be used with w, e, and l options.

	Without this option, the same filename as one that is read will be 
	used. When more than one filenames is specified, more than one MSDOS
	files is created. MSDOS files are created in the current directory
	in the current disk drive.

	With this option, the file read from the disk will be named
	as specified with the option. If more than one filenames is
	specified in the command line, all filenames are concatenated in the 
	order.
	A pathname can be specified with this option.

u	This option specifies a CP/M user number. The parameter should be
	from 0 to 31, decimal number. The default user number is 0.
	
	In a virtual disk, it is assumed that all CP/M files are in the
	user number specified with this option. Thus, when reading a file,
	displaying a filename, or erasing a file, only files that are in the 
	specified user number will be processed. When writing a file, the file
	is created in the specified user number.

d	This option specifies a virtual disk. Although the default has
	an appropriate name, please try to specify on every time. Any MSDOS 
	pathname can be specified for the parameter. The virtual disk must exist
	beforehand even if writing a file to the disk.

Filenames

	A CP/M filename consists of a
	primary name (Length is less than or equal to 8 characters.),
	, a period, and secondary name (Length is less than or equal 3 
	characters.). No spaces are allowed between characters. If no
	secondary name is included, a period can be omitted.

	Upper-case and lower-case characters are not distinguished and
	all characters are treated as upper-case characters.
	No wildcard is allowed.

EXAMPLES

	This example displays a filename ( in the user number 0) in the
	virtual disk "WORK.DSK".

	cpmfile -d word.dsk -l

	This example writes MSDOS text files, A.DOC and B.DOC to the disk.
	If there is a file with the same filename, it will be erased before
	writing.

	compfile -w -e -d work.dsk a.doc b.doc


	This example reads a binary file, SAMPLE.COM and writes to 
	a MSDOS file, B:\USER\SAMPLE.CPM. 
	
	cpmfile -b -d work.dsk -o b:\user\sample.cpm sample.com


BUGS

	When reading a file that includes unassigned blocks, the program
	reads until it encounters the unassigned block.
	Moreover, when the program writes a file without the e option
	a file has the same filename as one to be written which exists in the
	disk, and also the file has an unassigned block at the first extent,
	then no error will occur and the writing will processed incorrectly.

	The program doesn't check each character of a filename. Therefore, 
	when writing a file, a filename unacceptable under CP/M can be created.

	CP/M allows a filename that is unacceptable under MSDOS. 
	When reading this kind of filename, the o option should be used.

	Errors about the virtual disk won't be displayed correctly.

	When displaying filenames, only files in the specified user number 
	are displayed each time. In order to know in which user number
	a file exists, you need to try all 32 user numbers.

	No wildcard can be used.

	When writing a file,  a MSDOS file to be written must exist in
	the current directory in the current disk drive.  The same is
	true when reading files. The destination of files must be
	in the current directory in the current disk drive.

	The program can't correctly process attributes of CP/M files.
	When a CP/M file has attributes such as "read only",
	"system file", or "archived", the file can't be read or erased.
	When overwriting the file, it will end up with two files that
	have the same file name, one with attributes and one without them.
	The program can't correctly display a filename with attributes.

	If processing a non standard text file into a text file without
	the b option, the result may not be the same.
