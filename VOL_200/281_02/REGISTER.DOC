
			 Registration Information
				Version 5.1

Your copy of the Unicorn Library may be registered with the author which
entitles you to certain considerations.  Registration entitles you to the
complete library source code and a license to use the library functions
in programs you intend to sell or distribute in any other manner.  Please
specify the memory model you wish.  If you wish more than one memory
model please add $4.00 to the registration fee to cover costs for each
additional memory model you wish.
Any commercial use of the library requires full registration.  Alternately
you may indicate support of the library with 'user' registration for which
the author will remain forever grateful.  This does not include the source
code but simply indicates support for the author's efforts.


Currently the full registration with commercial license is $32.95 while
simple user registration is whatever you wish to show support.	Any
donation of $4.00 or more will bring a postcard to your mailbox indicating
when the next release is available.

Currently a Medium memory library has been compiled as has a small
model Turbo C Version 1.5.  ( 20 Sept 1988 )  The others should be
ready soon and avialability is anticipated within the next 5 or 6 weeks.
This should allow time for some testing before they are actually
released.  The author sees no reason why they should not compile
but does wish time to test before release.

If you request another model before it is ready you will be sent the
small model ( with all source code ) immediately and the other compiled
library as soon as it is ready and has undergone some testing.
