CHANGES:    Jan. 1989 port of GNU Bison to MS-DOS
            -------------------------------------


(source code downloaded from Unix node prep.ai.mit.edu in Nov. 1988.)

removal of assorted PASCALisms.

assorted char/int type conversion casts (big deal.)

general ANSIfication of code by exhaustive prototyping and 
external declaration generation for Microsoft v5.1 and 
TurboC v1.5 compilers.


alloca() replaced by malloc().
bcopy() redefined to memcpy().  /* memmove() required ?*/


Parser files BISON.SIMPLE and BISON.HAIRY renamed to 
simple.prs and hairy.prs, respectively.


FILES.C
        StringAppend() was removed in toto.

        filename handling and construction changed 
        in accord with DOS conventions.

        file copy ops converted to buffered block R/W
        ( using fread(), fwrite())

        temporary files are no longer unlinked immediately after
        opening them.

OUTPUT.C 
        "#line" filter rewritten to work and stop inserting EOF
        into middle of output file.
        file I/O changed from character to line/block sized units.
