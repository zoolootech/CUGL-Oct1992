This disk contains the source, help files and manual for ART-CEE, a small
artificial intelligence inference engine.  It is written in MIX-C for any 
MS-DOS computer and adaptable to most other dialects of C without much trouble.
The program requires approximately 128K of core in which to execute, half for
the .COM file and half for data.  It works with one- or two-disk machines.
No routines peculiar to one MS-DOS machine over others are used.
