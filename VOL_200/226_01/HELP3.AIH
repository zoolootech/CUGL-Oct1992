Queries are formed by adding a question mark to any rule construction or
by using 'who', 'what' or 'describe' followed by a subject.  ART-CEE
reduces these queries into subjects or subject/predicate pairs in the
same way that rules are reduced.
  
If the query reduces to a subject/predicate pair, ART-CEE searches for
all possible connections between subject and predicate.  If more than
one rule is used to make that connection, ART-CEE asks you to verify that
each intermediate rule is true in the current case.  If all rules 
involved are verified, then a conclusion is drawn, and you are asked
whether or not to add that conclusion to ART-CEE's store of knowledge.
  
If a 'who', 'what' or 'describe' query is entered, ART-CEE searches for
all immediately-known conclusions about the subject.  No searching
across multiple rules occurs.  No assumptions are made.  And ART-CEE's
knowledge base will not expand.
