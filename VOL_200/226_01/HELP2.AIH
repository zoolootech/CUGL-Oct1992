Rules are the basic information type in ART-CEE.  They consist of two
conditions or facts having a cause and effect relationship.  'If two
and two then four' is such a rule.  If the condition 'two plus two'
exists, then 'four' follows.
  
ART-CEE breaks all rules down into 'subject' and 'predicate' phrases.
These phrases are stored along with numbers describing the strength of
relationship between them.  A number of 0 means there is no cause and
effect relationship at all, and a number of 100 means absolute cer-
tainty that a cause and relationship always exists.  
 
The 'if' and 'then' in the rules are not stored.  Leading articles 
('a', 'an' and 'the') also are dropped from subject and predicate.  No
punction is acceptable upon entering a rule.
  
The program can store up to 60 subjects/predicates and up to 3540 
relationships between them.  Processing time and complexity increase
by the square of the number of subjects actually stored.
