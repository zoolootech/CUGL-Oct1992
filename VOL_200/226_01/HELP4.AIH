Commands are miniature utilities built into ART-CEE.
  
A  Set the number of assumptions that will be allowed in any single
   chain in two-element queries.  The minimum is 0; maximum is 57.
  
B  Enter a file containing mutually-exclusive subjects, and mark all
   occurrences of those subjects as mutually impossible.
  
C  Change a subject without changing any percentages associated with it
  
D  Drop a rule.  If the rule is the only one referencing a particular sub-
   ject, whether used as subject or predicate in that rule, the subject is
   dropped from ART-CEE's database.
  
F  Set default forward percentage of occurrence.  Valid values are not less
   than zero and not greater than 100.
  
G  Enter a group of mutually-exclusive subjects from the keyboard.  Only 
   subjects actually found in the database will be used or saved.
  
H  You know about the help command, don't you?
  
I  Initialize the database.  Erase all subjects in the database, and mark
   all percentages as zero except for tautologies (IF A THEN A), which
   are marked as impossible.
  
K  Set depth of thinking chaining.  The greater the depth the longer but
   more thorough will the thinking be.  Optimal is under 5.
  
L  Load a disk data file created in a previous ART-CEE session.
  
M  Toggle the showing of the main menu.
  
O  Toggle overriding of default percentages.
  
P  Print the database.  All rules in the database will be copied to the 
   system printer, together with their percentages.
  
R  Set default reverse percentage.  Valid values are not less than zero
   and not greater than 100.
  
S  Save the database to disk, in whole or in part.
  
T  Think.  Automated database extension by inference.
  
V  View the database.  All subjects are listed in order of entry, followed
   by their forward references, then their reverse references.
  
X  Exit the program.  You will be asked if you wish to save the database
   before the exit occurs.  The default is not to save.
