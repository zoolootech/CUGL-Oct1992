The main prompt allows three inputs:
  
RULES are the ways that ART-CEE increases its knowledge.  They
establish connections between facts.
  
QUERIES are ways that ART-CEE draws conclusions about the facts it
knows.  Queries can retrieve conclusions already drawn, draw new
conclusions and add those conclusions to ART-CEE's store of knowledge.
  
COMMANDS change defaults input values, set up or remove shortcuts
and manipulate data that ART-CEE has stored.
  
All inputs in ART-CEE must be in all upper case.  Any input longer than
one letter will be interpreted as a rule or query.
  
Enter the first letter of the topic you wish to explore.  Any other
input besides R, Q or C will return you to the main prompt.
