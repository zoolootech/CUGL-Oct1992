Brief descriptions for CUJ:

WALCLOCK is an animated analog clock face with sweep second hand and 
audible ticking. It displays, at your request, local time (according 
to DOS), Chinese time (where water clocks are less accurate), 
Australian time (where clocks run backwards due to the Coriolis 
force), or Reagan time (which is a bit erratic). Any of the above 
can be displayed in 12-hour or 24-hour format. This program serves 
no useful purpose. It is a graphics show-off program. It requires 
Hercules monochrome graphics.

HOD is the Hodgepodge machine, from Scientific American. It makes 
waves. See Scientific American, Aug. 1988, p. 104 for details. It 
serves no purpose, but demonstrates graphics. It requires Hercules 
monochrome graphics.

GEARS is a bicycle gear chart calculator. For bicycles with up to 
three chain rings and up to eight freewheels it will calculate your 
gears, in gear inches, and display them in a rectangular chart, 
showing the percentage change between adjacent chain rings and 
between adjacent freewheels. It also shows the gears in ascending 
order (leaving out the "forbidden" cross-over gears) and the 
percentage change from one to the next. Thus you can easily spot 
redundant gears or large gaps. And it shows the amount of chain 
slack. The program works like a mini-spreadsheet, recalculating the 
entire chart automatically every time you alter an entry. Thus you 
can experiment with gear combinations until you find one you like. 
No special display adapter is needed since all output is text, via 
stdio.

The executable programs are included on this disk for people who 
don't want to bother with the hassle of porting them to other 
compilers. These programs and their source code are public domain.
