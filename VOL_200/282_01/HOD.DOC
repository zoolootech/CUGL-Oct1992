Using the Hodgepodge Machine:

You can invoke the Hodgepodge Machine by simply typing

HOD

on the command line. 

However, there are a number of parameters that you may specify. They 
may be in any order. Each is invoked by a letter followed by an 
integer. THERE MUST BE NO SPACE BETWEEN THE LETTER AND THE INTEGER. 

Example:

HOD A3 B5 G41 M6 I1000

The above would do the following:

A3 would set k1, the infected cells divisor, to 3.

B5 would set k2, the ill cells divisor to 5.

G41 would set g, the infection rate, to 41.

M6 would set the randomizing rate to 6.

I1000 would set i, the initializing rate, to 1000.

Under ordinary circumstances you will not want to specify k1, k2, or 
the randomizing rate. These have defaults of 2, 3, and 0, 
respectively and the program will probably give the best results 
with these defaults. 

The infection rate, g, is the primary user-adjustment. Also the 
initializing rate may be worth playing with. Values of g much larger 
than about 75 or values of i much larger than about 10000 are 
probably pointless. 

The default for g is 25.

If i is not specified, all cells are initialized. If i is specified, 
only that number of cells will be initialized. But since the cells 
to be initialized will be selected at random, the actual number may 
be less than i.

All the above deals with beginning a new run. The alternatives are 
to resume an old run or to play back a sequence of frames saved from 
a previous run.

HOD PHODA

The above will cause HOD to playback the sequence in the file named 
HODA.MAT

HOD RHODA

The above will cause HOD to read in the data file named HODA.DAT and 
continue calculation from there.

Commands for use during operation of HOD:

# (crosshatch) will cause HOD to toggle movie recording on and off. 
Movies are sequences of frames which can later be viewed in a more 
rapid succession. Please note that movies take up about 4800 bytes 
of disk space per frame. A HARD DISK IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU 
ARE GOING TO RECORD MOVIES. The movie file will have a name with an 
extension of .MAT and a base name of four letters beginning HOD. The 
final letter will be selected so as not to conflict with any other 
file on the same directory. Thus the first movie will be named 
HODA.MAT, the second will be HODB.MAT, etc.

$ (dollar sign) allows you to specify the frame number at which 
movie recording will automatically stop. This lets you limit the 
size of movie files without constantly monitoring the program.

^W Writes the present data to a disk file. The file name will be 
created as for movies, except that the extension will be .DAT 
instead of .MAT

^D is the same as above except that the program exits after saving 
the data to a file.

^R reads in the data from a disk file. It has the same effect as 
using the P option on the command line. Data being worked on at the 
time ^R is invoked will be lost, so save your data before pressing 
^R if you don't want to lose it.

^B toggles screen blanking. You can cause the screen to go blank 
when you want to let the program run for a while without any 
display. Pressing ^B a second time restores the screen display.

^S causes the program to pause so you can look closely at the 
display. Pressing any key resumes operation.

^C terminates the program immediately without saving the present 
data.
