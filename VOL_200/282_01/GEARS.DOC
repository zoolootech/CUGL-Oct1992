Using GEARS:

You may specify the wheel size, the number of chain rings, and the 
number of freewheels on the command line. Precede the wheel size (in 
inches) with the letter W. Precede the number of chain rings with 
the letter C. Precede the number of freewheels with the letter F. Do 
not leave any space between the letter and the number. Thus if you 
have a 15 speed bike with 3 chain rings and 5 freewheels and a 26 
inch rear wheel you would type:

GEARS W26 C3 F5

If you leave out any or all of the parameters, the defaults are: 27 
inch wheel, 2 chain rings, 6 freewheels. You do not need to specify 
all the parameters. And you may give them in any order. The defaults 
may be changed at compile time. The macros that set the defaults are 
WHEEL, CHAINNUM, and FREENUM.

-------------------------------------------

Once you are into the program:

You must list freewheel sprocket numbers across the top, smallest on 
the left and largest on the right, and chain ring sprocket numbers 
along the side, largest on top. Crossover gears are marked with an 
asterisk in the chart and are automatically deleted from the 
numerical-order list below the chart.

Use ENTER or BACKSPACE to move the cursor to the next or previous 
gear. Or use up arrow and down arrow.

Use left-arrow and right-arrow to move cursor between digits of a 
gear.

Use TAB to toggle auto-advance. When auto-advance is on, the cursor 
advances to the next position when you have entered a number. Thus 
you can fill in the chart without having to press ENTER. When auto-
advance is off the cursor stays at the same position unless you 
press ENTER. Thus you can more easily play with a single gear 
number, trying a lot of different values to see what they do.

When auto-advance is on, the character > will appear in the upper 
left corner of the chart. When it is off, < will appear.

There is no provision for saving a chart to a file or printing a 
chart. Use PrtScr to print a screen display.

Press ? for a brief help screen.

Press X to exit from the program.

-------------------------------------------

Error Messages:

You will be warned if the freewheel or chain ring values are entered 
out of order. In either case the value of chain slack may be in 
error, and the numerical order list below the chart may be in error 
due to the wrong gears being deleted as crossovers.

If the chart is incomplete there will be no figure for slack number, 
but the partial chart will be correct, as far as it goes.
