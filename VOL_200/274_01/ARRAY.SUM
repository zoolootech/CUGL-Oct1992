                                 Arrays for C
                            Summary of Arrays for C
                                 Version 1.00



        Arrays  for  C version 1.00 is a set of C   header   files   that 
        simplifies  array  handling  in C. They  allow  four  classes  of 
        operations:  unary  (on  a single  array),  binary  (on  multiple 
        arrays),  fill  arrays, and information on arrays. They  work  on 
        mixed  types  (including constants), and should work  on  a  wide 
        range  of  compilers  and  computers  without  modification.  The 
        routines are available as shareware or retail.
