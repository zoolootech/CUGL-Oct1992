The files in this archive make up the complete source code for
OverView version 1.02.  Refer to the software license in the
OV.DOC file for restrictions on the use and distribution of this
source code.

OverView is written in a combination of Microsoft C version 4.0
and Microsoft MASM.  It is compiled as a small model program.  If
you have a different C compiler, it shouldn't be too difficult to
convert the source code to another compiler.  However, I do make
use of the Microsoft FAR keyword in quite a few places - if your
compiler doesn't support that keyword (or something like it) the
conversion will be more difficult.

I've included the makefile I use when building OverView, but it
is from a homegrown make program and may not be totally
compatable with the Microsoft (or other) make program.  If you
know enough to use make, you should be able to convert the
makefile without trouble.

In addition to the OverView source files, the source for the
CVTHLP program is also included.  CVTHLP converts an ascii text
help file to the format required by OverView.  The file OVHLP.TXT
is the current OverView help file in a format acceptable to
CVTHLP.  You can edit the OVHLP.TXT file (the format should be
obvious) and then create a new OV.HLP file by entering the
command:

   CVTHLP OVHLP.TXT OV.HLP

The file GETOPT.C requires special mention.  This is a public
domain version of a routine downloaded from the USENET network a
couple of years ago.  I believe this is the only file I did not
write from scratch.  GETOPT.C is used only by CVTHLP.C.

Please feel free to write with any comments, friendly criticisms,
problem reports, and improvement ideas you might have about the
product.  I hope that you find this program of use.  Thank you.
