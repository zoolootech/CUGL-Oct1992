     There are several example files for use with the sample programs. Try all 
of them to ensure the installation is completed. <cr> means the return key. 
All text within /* .. */ are comments and do not include them in your typing.
If you are using HGA half mode or CGA and you do not want to see error 
messages if any on the screen while in graphics mode, you may redirect the 
error messages to a file.
