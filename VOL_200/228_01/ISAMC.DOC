                An Approach to Supporting Indexed Sequential in C
                                                                         
        
        This archive contains a number of C functions which when debugged 
        will support Indexed Sequential files of arbitrary length. It was 
        "translated" from another language (which I  will  not  admit  to 
        knowing)  and will need some debugging since the time I thought I 
        would have to work on it has not materialized.  I therefore place 
        it  in  the  Public Domain and hope some inveterate tinkerer will 
        "fix" it and I can download it with no further worry on my  part. 
        Boy  wouldn't  it be nice if all software could be developed this 
        way??
        
        The  code  should  be fairly comprehensible as I do not try to be 
        cute or wickie when I code. A couple of points should suffice:
        
            .   Keys are for some reason only my subconcience knows 
                limited to 64 bytes in length.
        
            .   You must manage the data file -- ISAMC handles only the 
                keys retaining the record number of the data file.
        
        If someone gets this working,  it probably would be a good  thing 
        to write some documentation.  Any takers??
        
        My intent as far as coding anomalies are concerned was to compile 
        this under Lattice C.
        
        Good Debugging!!! John Dashner (404) 476-1797
