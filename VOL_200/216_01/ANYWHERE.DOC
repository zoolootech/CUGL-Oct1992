ANYWHERE.EXE  - A modification to Where for multiple hard disk users.

Anywhere grew out of a need for our corporate users who have installed
60 Meg Priam drives to search multiple hard disk directories for files
matching a particular file string.  One of our users had discovered
WHERE.C in PC TECH JOURNAL and asked me to convert it to compile on his
Lattice 2.14 C compiler.  After the program was distributed they came
back with "It works fine but what we really need is a program that can
search all our drives if we want it too.".  Since not everyone had the
same number of Hard drives I decided to utilize the set command to create
an environment string that could be used to guide WHERE as to what drives
should be searched.  By doing this a user can place the set command in
their autoexec.bat file tailored to his particular hard disk setup.  So
far no complaints.

ANYWHERE - Modifications to WHERE to allow mulitiple disk drives to be searched.

	Program modifications written to Microsoft Version 3.00 C compiler
	specifications.
	Modifications: Copyright 1985, 1986 by John Teichert Jr.
	Permission is granted to utilize the modifications for unlimited
	distribution if not sold or otherwise exchanged for gain.

WARRANTIES:

	NONE.  Requires DOS 2.x or 3.x to be utilized.

	ANYWHERE is distributed to the Public Domain as an ARCHIVE file
	utilizing ARC50.EXE as the compression routine.  It consists of three
	files.
		1.  AW.EXE		Executable Code.
		2.  ANYWHERE.C		Program source.
		3.  ANYWHERE.DOC	Documentation.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

	ANYWHERE Locates files on hard drives on the IBMPC.  Can be setup to
	search mulitple hard drives or diskettes utilizing an environment
	string.

PROGRAM USAGE:

		AW [d:][\path\]filespec

Required parameters:

		filespec	the file specification that ANYWHERE is to
				search for.  Must include the extension if
				ANYWHERE is to resolve the filespec correctly
				since nothing will be appended to the specifi-
				cation.  Can (and most times will) include
				DOS global substitution characters "*" and "?".

Optional parameters:

		d:		A drive specifier to tell ANYWHERE to restrict
				the search to a particular drive.

		\path\		Restricts ANYWHERE to begin searching from the
				specified path instead of begining at the root
				directory.

Usage Example:

		AW D:FY85*.WK?

		ANYWHERE is to search the "D" drive for any file with FY85
		as the first four characters and  WK as the first and second
		characters of the extension.  The third charcter of the
		extension can be anything. (i.e. Lotus 123 version 1a and
		version 2 worksheets dealing with fiscal year 1985).  The
		is to begin in the ROOT directory of the "D" drive.

		AW \LOTUS\*.PRN

		ANYWHERE is to search the current working directory and any
		directories specified in the AWDISK= environment string for
		files that are under the LOTUS main subdirectory and have
		the extension .PRN.

Environment String Specification:

		set AWDISK=d:[;d:[;d:.....d:]]

Required Parameters:

		NONE		If the set command is issued without any para-
				meters it will nullify the Environment string
				and ANYWHERE will only search the current
				working directory or the specified drive if
				one was given in the command line parameter.

Optional Parameters:

		d:		Allows ANYWHERE to search multiple drives that
				are specified in the Environment string as well
				as the current working directory.

Environment Examples:

		set AWDISK=c:

		ANYWHERE is to search the "C" drive and the current working
		directory if no drive specifier is given.

		SET AWDISK=C:;E:;D:

		ANYWHERE is to search the "C" drive, the "E" drive, and the
		"D" drive as well as the default directory in the order given
		if no drive specifier is given.

Restrictions:

	The program cannot repeat cannot be used with any version of DOS
	below 2.x.

	AWDISK= must be capitalized.  This is done automatically by
	DOS 3.0.  Use set without any operands to ensure that this is
	true in prior or future releases.

	A limit of 16 drives can be specified in the environment string.
	If 16 drives are specified (Lord amighty why are you running DOS)
	the current working directory cannot be added to the search list.

	The program was linked using an 8K stack space.  If this proves
	to be insuffiecient (Hasn't yet though) the stack must be increased
	using Microsoft's EXEMOD program distributed with the Microsoft's
	Assembler 4.0 or C compiler 3.0 as well perhaps with all the new
	versions of their other compilers.  The program checks for stack
	usage so it will inform you if there is a stack problem.

BUGS: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	If the environment string is terminated with a semicolon the current
	working directory will not be searched.  Regard this as either a bug
	or a feature.  Take your choice.

	The file spec must be legal (less than 64 characters including drive
	specifiers.  If not string corruption can occur with unpredictable
	results.  (i.e. Strange file names etc.)).  This includes drive
	specifiers in the environment string.

	No validation is performed on the Drive specifiers.  They are accepted
	as written.  Message "Problem with looking thru........." will appear.

Operation:

	ANYWHERE first determines whether or not a drive specification was
	contained in the command line parameter.  If a drive specifier was
	included then no search is done for additional drives and the program
	immediately begins searching for the filespec given on the command
	line.  If a path is given as well the search will be restricted to
	that drive and path.  This is quickest form of searching.

	If there was no drive specification a search is made of the environment
	strings to see if any match the AWDISK= string.  If no environment
	string matches then only the current working directory is searched
	for the file spec.

	If an environment string is located the drives are extracted in the
	the order given.  Each drive found is examined to see if it matches
	the drive of the current working directory.  If the current working
	directory is not matched up to a drive in the environment string it
	is added to the list of drives to search as the last drive.

	For each drive specified in the environment string as well as the
	default drive ANYWHERE begins from the ROOT directory unless a path
	is specified searching for matches on the filespec given on the
	command line.
