     This  is  just  a little nick-knack of a  program  that  I  threw 
together  when I read in the Ecosoft documentation that their floating 
point  math was implemented as a software emulation of the  8087  math 
chip.  I  have  always wished that my CP/M Kaypro could be fitted  out 
with  a  math chip.  Of course "software emulation"  lacks  the  speed 
advantage  of a dedicated chip.  But nevertheless I was moved to write 
this little "calculator" program.  It is not resident. It does not pop 
up like the fancy commercial programs.  But it should give exactly the 
same answers as the 8087 IF (and I stress IF) it is compiled with  the 
Eco-C88,  or  some other compiler that emulates the 8087.  (Or if  you 
actually have an 8087, of course!).
     This program works more or less like a very cheap calculator.  It 
has addition,  subtraction,  multiplication, and division. It has sin, 
cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan. It will do squares and square roots. 
It  will  take reciprocals.  It will raise one number to the power  of 
another. And it has ten memories.
     It does not recognize parentheses.  You must do your calculations 
one at a time.  However you can use the memories to hold  intermediate 
results.
     To  find  roots  (other  than  square  root,  which  is  directly 
supported) use the reciprocal. Example:
     To find the 35th root of 987, first take the reciprocal of 35 and 
put  it  in  a  memory.  Then raise 987 to the power  of  that  stored 
reciprocal. This works with fractional numbers as well.
     It  should be simple to extend this program to  include  whatever 
functions you find useful or interesting.
     This  program  is  not  intended to be anything  but  a  toy.  Do 
whatever you like with it.
     Please note that it distinguishes between upper and lower case on 
the inputs.
     With  minor  changes it compiles and runs under Aztec  C  II  for 
CP/M. (Though it then does not give the same accuracy.)
