                       INDEX OF THIS DISKETTE

KITTYLNT.C     This is my psuedo-lint program.  Or, if you prefer, a 
               delimiter  checker.  It  checks  C  source  code  for 
               balanced brackets,  correct line termination, correct 
               number of parameters in printf() statements and for() 
               loops. The CRC of this file is 145E

               This file,  exactly as it is,  compiles under Aztec C 
               II v. 1.06D. I hope that it is reasonably portable. I 
               have not had the chance to try it on other compilers. 
               It  is very heavily annotated,  thus it is both a  .c 
               file and a .doc file.

KITTYLNT.COM   This  is the above program,  compiled.  It runs on my 
               Kaypro 2X using CP/M 2.2.  I hope it will run on  any 
               CP/M  2.2  computer.  I  have not had any  chance  to 
               verify this on other computers. CRC is 534A.

KITTYLNT.C88   This  is the same program again,  except modified  to 
               compile under the Ecosoft MS-DOS compiler. Exactly as 
               it  is it compiles under Eco-C88 v3.14 and runs on my 
               SWP Co-Power Plus (an 8088 coprocessor board). CRC is
               4E5E.


KITTYLNT.DOC   A bit of documentation for all the  above.  Basically 
               they are internally documented. CRC is FBA2.

CALC87.C       This is a little calculator program.  Inspired when I 
               saw  that the Ecosoft compiler emulates the  8087  in 
               software. Really this is just a toy. Nothing fancy at 
               all. CRC is DF16.

CALC87.DOC     A bit of documentation for the above. CRC E27F.

REVIEW.TXT     This is my review of Aztec C II for CP/M. 
               CRC of this file is B7CD.

NSWEEP.COM     I put this file utility on all disks. I leave it here 
               for your convenience. CRC is 2335.

-KITTENS.OFT   This is a disk label and also my silly logo. 
               CRC is 6FFB.
