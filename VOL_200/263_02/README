
Welcome to the Marietta Systems "c_wndw" and "c_ndx" shareware libraries
========================================================================

This libraries for Turbo C and Quick C provides windows, menus, formatted 
entry, file access, indexed file, and relational database functions.  The 
libraries make it easy to write C programs of professional appearance, 
quality and performance.

The Manual
==========

The shareware manual for this set of software will be found in file 
'MANUAL' and is 31 pages long.  To print it out type:

 TYPE A:MANUAL > PRN


Installation
============

To install the software:

 for Turbo C - Put the first diskette in drive A: and type A:TURBOC

 for Quick C - Put the second diskette in drive A: and type A:QUICKC

The software will then install on to the default hard disc drive. 
Installation to diskette will require some changes to these batch files.

Both the installation batch files create a directory MARIETTA.  Copy the 
sample *.C programs into this directory.  For TurboC you should also copy
the *.PRJ files, and for QuickC the *.MAK files.


Bulletin board and ARC-issued software update:
==============================================

The install programs are designed to install from the diskette drive A:. 
When you un-ARC the software you should copy it to a diskette, or amend the 
install program to work from your hard disc!

===============

Shareware is a software marketing concept that allows potential users
of a software product to thoroughly test and investigate it before
committing to license it.  The concept is nicknamed "try before you buy".

A true shareware version of a product is fully featured software, not 
"crippleware", and the "c_wndw" and "c_ndx" libraries are excellent
examples of this.  The only feature specific to the shareware is the
shareware message window that appears at the start of each program.

2. Hints and recommendations
============================

2.a. Microsoft C 
----------------

 When using the QuickC debugger or Codeview you may notice that some key 
 entries go astray.  This is a problem with Microsoft C.  You can get around
 this by setting SAVEWAIT to zero during the debugging sessions.

 The libraries require QuickC version 2.0 or equivalent Microsoft C 5.x.  The 
 libraries do not work with Microsoft C 4.x or earlier versions.

 If you have QuickC 1.0, the sample programs will probably compile and work,
 but with linker errors.  We recommend you upgrade to the vastly superior
 QuickC 2.0!

 The MAK files are very useful, but you will probably need to modify them
 before you can use them.

 By the way, when you register we supply a QuickC QuickHelp format file.

2.b. Turbo C
------------

 The libraries require Turbo C 2.0.  If you have 1.0 or 1.5, the sample 
 programs will probably work with linker errors, but 2.0 is strongly
 recommended.

2.c. ASP
--------

 These libraries are produced by Marietta Systems, a member of the Association
 of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
 principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related
 problem with an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able
 to  help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with
 an ASP member, but it does not provide technical support for members'
 products. Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at P.O. Box 5786, Bellevue, WA
 98006 or send a Compuserve message via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.

3. The sample programs
======================

.PRJ and .MAK files are provided with the sample programs to assist you 
compile and link these programs under the Turboc and QuickC environments.

The sample programs should be compiled under the medium memory model, to
match the MC_WNDW.LIB and MC_NDX.LIB libraries supplied on this shareware
software issue.

3.a. HELLO.C
-------------

The classic understanding of a C language environment is a small program
to display the message "hello world" to the screen.  The HELLO.C program
is this small program.  It opens a window on the screen and displays the
"hello world" message.

3.b. WINDOW.C
-------------

The program shows the creation and removal of overlapping windows.  If you
have a color screen notice the automatic change of colors between windows.

The "c_wndw" libraries makes and removes windows extremely quickly, and 
a half second delay is built into the program between each window.

3.c. MENU.C
-----------

The program shows the use of the menu() function with a simple menu in a 
floating window.  It also shows the use of the flt_wndw() function.

3.d. MESSAGE.C
--------------

The program shows the use of message and query windows with the err_wndw()
and qry_wndw() functions.  It also shows the use of the acptint() function
to enter an integer value from the keyboard.

3.e. DATETEST.C
---------------

The program shows the use of the date facilities under the "c_wndw" 
libraries.  The system date is read and can be subsequently modified
through the keyboard by the accept() function.  It also shows the use
of the set_keys() function to activate the "Esc" key.

3.f. MONY.C
-----------

The program shows the use of the mony functions.  The mony type is a
variable with two implied decimal places that can contain any value in the
range 9,999,999.99- to 9,999,999.99 .  This allows most monetary values 
(ex: prices, financial computations) to be figured without the performance
and rounding problems of doubles.

3.g. WRITFILE.C
---------------

The program shows the use of file access functions to create a file with 
a record size of 61 bytes.  You are prompted to enter the records which
are written to the end of the field.

3.h. READFILE.C
---------------

The program reads the file created by the WRITFILE.C program.  The file is
read by record number.

3.i. DBREAD.C
-------------

The program reads sequentially through an indexed dBASE file and displays
a field from the file.  The data file is opened with the fileopen() 
function, and the index file with the ndxopen() function.  The records 
are read with the ndxread() function, and the field displayed with the 
dispdbf() function.

3.j. DBUPDATE.C
---------------

The program opens an indexed dBASE file and allows you to read forwards 
and backwards through it to view and modify the records.  A further option
is to add new records to the file.
