FAFNIR, Version 3.0
December 18, 1988, David C. Oshel

Purpose:   A general-purpose forms engine for data entry, with unlimited
           data types, but standard field types are predefined as macros;
           i.e., TEXT, DOLLAR, DATE, PHONE, SSN, DISPLAY, VIRTUAL, etc.

           This is a C programmer's tool, distributed as source code.

           The forms engine is a standard table-driven (C structure)
           general-purpose routine, with slots for pointers to field
           initialization, character validation, and field validation 
           functions, plus default field contents.  The macros defined
           in FAFNIR.H practically eliminate "essential details" micro-
           management, by providing the programmer with standard types
           and bullet-proof, automatic attention to structure syntax.

           The graininess of standard types varies from YESNO, which
           requires field name and x and y location of the field, to
           FIELD, which accepts/requires ALL parameters for total
           "free form" field type definition.

           The engine uses dynamic allocation, but there is a tradeoff
           in favor of programmer's peace of mind; the field names are
           declared as type char *, and take up external storage to the
           tune of number of fields times sizeof(char *).  Fields must
           be allocated before use, and data must be transferred from
           fields to file before the allocation is released.  You get
           the not-so-primitives, the rest is a breeze.

           Of course, the engine is still not as feature-loaded as most
           of the better commercial forms packages, but it covers 99% of
           the average end-user's data entry needs.

           Portability:  Screen and keyboard i/o source code is provided;
           the engine runs all it's i/o through the CIAO library defined
           in the FAFNIR make script.  On a decent operating system, the
           whole i/o package could be replaced by macros, but we will
           probably never see that ideal universe in our lifetimes.  In
           the meantime, this is as close as you'll get to Elysian Fields
           and Forms Nirvana on plain ol' practical Earth.

Do this:   C>MAKEIT.BAT

Produces:  FAFNIR4L.LIB  - all i/o and forms editing, in LARGE model 
           FAFNIR.EXE    - program to test and demonstrate a 2-page form

           Executables, header files and pre-compiled: FAFNIR4x.LIB (Large
           & Small) are included in the distribution, plus the magic macro 
           header file, FAFNIR.H.  The demonstrations, and ES.EXE, a 
           primitive screen editor, are included as pre-compiled executables.

Requires:  Microsoft C version 5.00, plus the standard MSC utilities
           Microsoft Assembler (MASM) version 5.1 (two modules only)
           MS-DOS 2.0
           100% IBM PC-XT compatible screen RAM and ROM BIOS (but see
           the Portability discussion, above)

Assumes:   Hard disk.

           You should have your compiler installed, and PATH and environment
           variables for MS C compilation established.  MAKEIT.BAT assumes 
           the total development environment is ready to go, including MAKE,
           LINK and LIB for use with MASM 5.1 and MS C 5.0 or better.
