Notes:

(1) Since the files on this disk were renamed for submission to the CUG,
    they should be renamed as follows when compiling.

       REN MAKEFILE.?? MAKEFILE  (For the appropriate program)
       REN *.?I *.?
       REN *.?R *.?
       REN *.?S *.?

(2) As always, the following command compiles the code for Microsoft C.

       MAKE MAKEFILE

(3) Have fun!
