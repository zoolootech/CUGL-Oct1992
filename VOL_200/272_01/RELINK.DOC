This information is provided here since the main users manual was
already finished when I decided to provide the batch files and
library response files to allow remaking the libraries.

If you want to remake the entire library, the procedure can be
automated with a series of batch files and librarian response files.

You will need, besides Datalight C of course, Microsoft MASM assembler and
the LIB librarian utility which comes with MASM.

There are 4 batch files and 4 librarian response files:
     MAKES.BAT    LIBS            Small memory model
     MAKED.BAT    LIBD            Large Data memory model
     MAKEP.BAT    LIBP            Large Code memory model
     MAKEL.BAT    LIBL            Large Data & Code memory model

To remake the libraries, you will most likely need to be on a
hard disk.  I don't think a dual floppy system can handle it all
in one chunk.  If you have a floppy system, you will have to remake
the library in pieces, bringing in only a few source files at a time.

On a hard drive, make a subdirectory and copy onto it all source and header
files, plus the above named batch and lib* files from the "Steve's Library"
distribution disk.  Make sure that this directory does NOT have the
library files SMDL?.LIB!

Then, making sure that DLC*.EXE, MASM.EXE, and LIB.EXE are in your current
PATH, simply execute each of the batch files.  They will recompile and
reassemble each source files and then create a new library file from the
OBJ files.  Copy the object files into the directory which has the Datalight
library files, and then you can delete everything in the working directory.

If you choose to keep the working directory on disk, you can save space
after remaking the files by doing:
              erase *.obj
              erase *.lst

The batch files and librarian response files are only supplied with
full source registration.

As supplied, the batch files invoke the Datalight Optimim-C optimizer.
If you do NOT have that program, the remove the "-o" option from each
"dlc" line in every batch file.
