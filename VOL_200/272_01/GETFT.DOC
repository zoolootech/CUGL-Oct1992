                get_filetime -- get file date/time stamp

        SYNOPSIS
                #include <time.h>
                void get_filetime(ptm, fh);
                struct tm *ptm;     pointer to tm structure
                int fh;             file handle of opened file


        DESCRIPTION
        Datalight gives a function to set the date/time of a file,
        but none to fetch it!.  This function corrects that omission.
        The data from the file is placed in the specified time
        structure (see Datalight "time.h"), in the same format as used
        by other time functions by Datalight.  The file must be opened,
        and a file handle passed, NOT a FILE pointer.  No error is
        returned from this function.  The structure elements tm_wday
        and tm_yday are always returned as 1, as they are generally
        irrelevant for file dates.  They can subsequently be calculated
        from the other information.



        EXAMPLE
           #include <time.h>
           #include <smdefs.h>
           FILE *fp;
           char *string;
           struct tm *stamp;

           /* report the date/time of a specified file on command line */
           main(argc, argv) int argc; char *argv[]; {
              if(argc isnot 2) exit(0);
              if((fd = fopen(argv[1], "r")) is NULL) exit(0);
                     /* note conversion of FILE *fd to file handle next: */
              get_filetime(stamp, (fileno(fd)));
              fclose(fd);
              string = asctime(stamp);
              printf("File %s modified on %s\n", argv[1], string);
              }
