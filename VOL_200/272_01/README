Steve's Library for Datalight C

Version 1.30
The file SMLIBDL.DOC should be printed out.  This will
give directions for printing further documentation on each
function, and installation of the library.

If you have received the full source registration, please also
printout the file RELINK.DOC.

If you have a prior version of this library you will notice that
the version 1.30 libraries are considerably smaller than the previous
version, but actually have more functions.  This is because I am now
using the LIB librarian utility which comes with MASM instead of
the Lattice OML librarian.  The latter apparently has a much larger
default "page" size, resulting in a significant amount of wasted
space in the *.lib files.  The result of using LIB is smaller
files which link faster as well.
