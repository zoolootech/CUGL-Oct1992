1. Highlights

	Conversational mode with optional capture to file and 
	multiple page review of past output.  File capture of long 
	files works with any system which responds to XON-XOFF 
	protocol.

	Flexible uploading of suitable files to many types of remote 
	systems, even Bulletin Boards without normal uploading 
	capability.

	Error checking file exchange with programs using Ward 
	Christensen's protocol with optional Cyclic Redundancy 
	Check.  Enhanced error recovery and transfer abort logic.

	Batch transmission of files with compatible programs.

	High speed operation, 9600 baud file transfer and 
	conversational terminal operation.  Buffered printer 
	operation at >>1200 baud.  Full printer buffering allows use 
	of slow printers, or printers with burst transfers (line 
	printer, MX80, etc.).  Function key escape sequences can be 
	buffered, allowing proper operation when keyboard baudrate 
	exceeds host baud rate.

	Disk utility functions including directory listing, change 
	disk and/or directory, erase files, disk free space 
	calculation, file transfer time calculation, CRCK file 
	check, and local listing of files.

	Full support for pathnames, subdirectorys.

	Great flexibility in specifying filenames.  New data may be 
	appended to existing ASCII files.  Optionally, YAM can 
	maintain log of files sent and/or received with disk, 
	filename, baud rate, and the name of the remote system.

	Written in C, a modern high level systems language for ease 
	of portability and maintenance.

2. Definitions

CAPTURE
	When in the T(term) function, ALL data coming from the remote 
	is captured in a circular buffer.

DUMPING
	When a receive file is open as a result of a "t  filename" 
	command, and the circular buffer is nearly full, that data 
	is written out to the receive file if Dumping is on.  
	Setting Squelch mode (see below) turns Dumping off until a 
	^R character is encountered.

FUNCTION
	An operation supported by yam, such as DIR, TYPE, S, R, or 
	T(term).  A command may set or reset a MODE, or perform 0 or 
	more FUNCTIONS.

HOST
	The ``other machine'' with which YAM is communicating.  This 
	may be with either a direct RS-232 connection or through a 
	pair of modems.

MODE
	Many modes affect the way the term function handles data.

OPTION
	Option(s) apply to the S and R commands only.

PREFIX
	A letter that prefixes a command to modify its action.

REPLOT
	Traditional term (from early days of Tek Graphics) referring 
	to the rapid redisplay of previously calculated 
	information.  In the case of YAM, the data remaining in the 
	capture buffer may be paged and/or searched with the replot 
	function.

{}
	Required argument.

[]
	Optional argument.

pattern ...
	An empty pattern represents all files on the default disk in 
	the current working directory.  A disk identifier without 
	filename represents all files on that disk in the current 
	directory.  Unambiguous and ambiguous filenames may be 
	specified in any combination.  A pattern may contain any 
	combination of the above.

3. Prefixes and Commands

3.1 a:
	Change to a: disk (or b, etc.) some versions print the free 
	disk space in kilobytes.

3.2 b m
	Set baudrate to m.  Example: "b 9200"

3.3 br{eak}
	Sends a break.

3.4 bye
	Dump any connection in progress by dropping DTR (data 
	terminal ready).  A call or on command must be given to 
	reassert DTR before making or answering another data call.

3.5 call name
	If the first character of name is a letter, yam searches the 
	PHONES file for name.  If the search is successful, enable 
	Data Terminal Ready (DTR), and set baudrate to the value (if 
	present) corresponding to name.  If autodial is supported, 
	dial the telephone number.  The specifics of autodial 
	operation may vary with the implementation.  If autodial is 
	notsupported, the telephone number is displayed.  It is not 
	necessary to type the entire name as it appears in the file, 
	as YAM will find the first entry that is a prefix of name.  
	If the first character of name is not a letter, yam assumes 
	a telephone number has been entered directly.

	Example: "call tcbbs" or "call tc"

3.6 cd pattern ...
	change current directory to pathname.  Function the same as 
	the dos or Unix cd command.

3.7 ch
	change port configuration.  System will prompt for data bits, 
	parity and stop bits.

3.8 chat
	Chat keyboard to keyboard.  Characters typed by either 
	keyboard are echoed to both ends, and RETURNS echo as  
	RETURN/LINEFEED.  Chat will become hostile if the other end 
	also echoes characters.

3.9 close
	Dump capture buffer if a receive file is open, close files.

3.10 crc [pattern ...]
	Print the "crc" checksum and character count for the 
	specified files.  The checksum is calculated with the same 
	alogrithim as the CP/M CHEK.COM program.  This command is 
	slower but possibly more accurate than the crck command.

3.11 crck [pattern ...]
	Print the "crck" checksum and sector count for the specified 
	files.  The "crck" algorithm is stolen from version 4.3 
	CRCK.ASM.

3.12 e{mode[s]}
	Enable mode(s) affecting file transmission/reception with the 
	term function.  (The "s" and "r" commands always send data 
	transparently.)


3.13 d{mode[s]}
	Disable mode(s) affecting file transmission/reception with 
	the term function.

3.14 debug
	Cause an interrupt to the operating system for use with 
	debuggers.  The MS-DOS version does an INT 3.  NOTE: the 
	debugger must have previously set up the vector location for 
	this command to function properly.

3.15 del pattern ...
	Delete the named files.  For each matched pathname, the user 
	is prompted for Y, N, or Q.  Y erases the file, N skips to 
	the next file, and Q or anything else aborts the command.

3.16 dir [pattern ...]
	Displays the directory with the number of bytes in each 
	file.  The number of files matched, number of blocks, number 
	of kb allocated to those files, and estimated transmission 
	time at the current baudrate for all files listed are 
	displayed.  Transmission time estimate is based on batch 
	transmission and the formula:
	blocks per minute =
	       (Baudrate*60)/(10 bits each char * 136 chars)
	Time does not include error correction.  The usual ambiguous 
	filenames are allowed. Example: "dir" "dir *.c" "dir yam*.c" 
	"dir *.c *.h"

3.17 dump [pattern ...]
	Dump the named files in side by side hex/ascii format.  Zero 
	length files will not be displayed.

3.18 f[mode[s]] name
	Send file 'name' in the term function.  The optional mode 
	enables one or modes.  If squelch is enabled, preface with 
	^R and append with ^T.

3.19 help
	Displays a command summary.  This command closes any open 
	send file.

3.20 init{ialize}
	Initializes yam to all its default values.  Does not reset 
	the modem or file system(see "reset").

3.21 kill
	Kill all data in the capture buffer.  Restores the pointers 
	to their initial positions.

3.22 mn
	Change data port to (decimal) n.  Example: "m1" The domain of 
	correct port numbers and consequences arising from incorrect 
	port numbers vary with the implementation.


3.23 o{ff}
	Disable the modem by turning off DTR.

3.24 pxm
	Set Parameter x to value m.

3.25 pwd
	Print pathname to the current working directory.

3.26 qu
	quit to DOS without dropping DTR to modem.  This allows exit 
	to  the operating system, and subsequent re-entry without 
	causing the  modem to disconnect.

3.27 reset [size]
	Dump the capture buffer; if a file is open, close all files, 
	and reset modem.  The optional argument size becomes the 
	size of the circular capture buffer, useful for debugging.

3.38 replot [m]
	Redisplay the last m lines and/or escape sequences received 
	from the host.  If m is 0 or absent, redisplay starting with 
	the earliest data.  A screenful is displayed at a time.  The 
	commands accepted in replot mode are listed below.

3.39 rewind
	Rewind the buffer pointers for the display, printer, and file 
	dump from the term function.  The effect of this command is 
	the same as if the data had been sent another time.

3.40 r[options] [file ...]
	Receive with options 1 or more files using the Ward 
	Christensen protocol.  If no filename is given, batch mode 
	is assumed.  (Note: batch mode is not compatible with 
	MODEM7).  If more than one filename is given, a single file 
	transfer will be made for each.  If the RESTRICTED option is 
	defined, a file received in error will be unlinked (erased).

3.41 s
	Displays status information about YAM configuration.

3.42 sum pattern ...
	Sums the named source files with an algorithm compatible with 
	sum(1) on Version 7 Unix (sum -r on System III). Carriage 
	returns, and all characters starting with CPMEOF are 
	excluded from the calculation.  This processing allows 
	comparison of source files stored on different systems but 
	not ``binary'' files.

3.43 s[options] pattern ...
	If batch mode is specified with the b option, 0 or more files 
	are 
		sent according to the ambiguous pathname(s).  If batch mode is not 
	specified, the named unambiguous file(s) are sent each in single 
	file mode.

3.44 tab n
	Set tab expansion to n.  If n=0, or not present, the tabs are 
	reset to the default as found in the configuration file.

3.45 type pattern [...]
	Type the file(s) specified by one or more possibly ambiguous  
	pattern(s).  This command closes any open send file.  Yam  
	compiled with USQ defined will automatically detect squeezed 
	files and print them in ASCII.  Type stops/resumes printing with 
	^S.  Keyboarding ^C cancels, and ^X skips to the next file.

3.46 t[c][mode] [file]
	The term function with optional capture to file.  0 or more modes 
	may be enabled.  The c (close) mode causes data in the capture 
	buffer to be written to file and closed immediately.  View mode 
	causes the term function to display control characters by 
	prefixing ^ to the corresponding letter.  Characters with the 8th 
	bit set will be prefixed by a ~.  If the free buffer space 
	becomes low, yam attempts an xoff-dump-xon sequence.  A receive 
	file previously opened by 't file' will not be closed by a 
	't'command.

	Keyboarded characters are treated in either of two ways depending 
	on the value of Exitchar (see parameters, below). If Exitchar is 
	non zero, term will return when a character matching Exitchar is 
	keyboarded, and all others are passed without any special 
	action.  Otherwise, the following subcommands are available:

3.46.1 ^b
	Break.  Sends a break signal to the remote.  The break key on your 
	terminal will probably generate a ^@ (NULL) character.  After the 
	break is sent, any remaining keyboard input (usually garbage from 
	a break character) is discarded.

3.46.2 ^E
	Exits from the term function back to main command level.  Rapidly 
	typing ^E^E will instead cause one ^E to be transmitted.

3.46.4 ^Q
	If a send file is open and its transmission has been stopped by a 
	XOFF, transmission is resumed.  Otherwise no special treatment.

3.47.4 ^S
	If a send file is open and it is being transmitted, transmission 
	is stopped.  Otherwise no special treatment.

3.46.6 ^R
	Replots up to 24 lines starting with either the first character 
	received after the last character keyboarded, or as much as in 
	the buffer if less than 24 lines have been received.  This allows 
	the output from the last command to be conveniently reviewed.  
	Replot then awaits next replot command (see below).  ^R^R typed 
	quickly sends one ^R instead.


	The following received characters are recognized in the term  
	function, when they are fetched from the circular buffer for the 
	display.

3.46.8 SO
	If Cis02 mode is in effect, turns on the Compuserve A protocol.  
	This protocol is used with the XFTRAN program and the DOW command 
	of SIG/ACCESS.  See yam4.c and Compuserve's CP-MIG user group for 
	more information.

3.46.9 XOFF
	Stops file transmission from yam.

3.46.10 XON
	Resumes file transmission.

3.46.11 TAB
	Some versions of YAM expand tab characters to spaces on the  
	display.  BUG: Since YAM does not decode cursor addressing  
	commands, these commands should not be intermixed with tabs on 
	the same line.

3.47 w
	Write dumps the circular buffer to the receive file, if open.

3.48 wc pattern ...
	Takes a count of lines, words, characters excluding returns, and 
	all text characters for the given files.  Characters beginning 
	with CPMEOF are excluded.  On 8 many versions, counts are modulo 
	64k.

3.49 x
	same as bye.

3.50 ! command
	Create a shell to execute a DOS command.  For this function to work,
	the dos PATH must be set so the file command.com can be found.  For
	Lattice-C versions, SWITCHAR must be not be reset from the default "\".

3.51 ;
	Semicolon is an optional command delimiter which may be used in 
	place of RETURN in order to place multiple commands on a line.

4. MODES used with D, E, F, T or U commands

	!
	Negates the sense of the following mode.  For example, t!l will 
	turn off the line printer.

	2
	Enables Compuserve A protocol if this feature is included.  N.B.  
	Non-ASCII files or files without CR's must be uploaded in 
	Cpmpuserve's binary mode.

	a
	A return from the keyboard is sent as return, linefeed. If half 
	duplex, both are sent to the console.

	b
	Binary mode of TRANSMISSION with T function.  All 8 bits are 
	sent.  Handy for downloading binary files to adjacent machines 
	without any modem program.  Don't confuse this with the S 
	function which uses the Christensen protocol.  Also don't confuse 
	with i mode which affects files received with the T function.

	d
	Directly enables/disables dumping of captured text is squelch mode 
	is in effect.  If squelch mode is not in effect, always enables 
	dumping.

	e
	with term command, echo characters received from the host to the 
	host.  Use this only for keyboard to keyboard communication, and 
	then only at one end. Reset after each command.  Does not imply 
	"Half Duplex".

	With the f command, selects an alternate file transmission 
	function sendecho() which waits for an echo to each character 
	transmitted (for Throttle/10 seconds).  The echoed character is 
	output to console. See "propagating yam" below.  Often it is 
	fairly easy to write a simple receive routine which synchronizes 
	with the sender by the simple expedient of echoing the characters 
	received.  On Heath/Zenith CP/M system, the pip device "TTY:" 
	does just that.

	f
	Full duplex.

	g
	Resumes (GO) sending file once in the term function, equivalent to 
	XON.  Disabling GO causes a file queued for transmission to wait 
	for an XON character.

	h
	Half Duplex.  Displays keyboarded characters as they are sent to 
	the host.

	i
	Ignrx flag.  When set this will cause characters defined by the 
	RXNONO string to be ignored in the term() mode.  If reset, all
	characterts are passed thru.  This flag may be set or reset by
	the call command based on information in YAMPHONE.T.

	k
	Set the buffer size used in the s or r commmands.  Non-compatible  
	with MODEM7.

	l
	List unit (Printer) on.  Since the printer is separately buffered, 
	it needn't be as fast as the incoming data as long as the 
	difference doesn't exceed the buffer size.  The rewind command 
	may be used to get extra copies of the received data.

	n
	Called nlmode, after the corresponding tty mode in Unix systems.  
	Send NEWLINE (lf) only when transmitting file (no CR).  Send 
	keyboarded CR as NEWLINE.  When receiving a file to disk with the 
	term function, NEWLINE is stored on disk as \\r \\n.

	p
	When sending files with the term command, wait to receive GOchar 
	after sending a CR at the end of a line.  The default for GOchar 
	is linefeed (see parameter g below).  If GOchar is not received, 
	the wait times out and transmission proceeds in the same manner 
	as with w mode.  The duration of this timeout is controlled by 
	the p parameter.

	r
	Called crmode.  Sends CR only at the end of each transmitted line.

	s
	Squelch the dumping of captured data with ^T and unsquelch with 
	^R.  These characters are not copied to the file.  When a receive 
	file is opened with Squelch mode is selected, writing to the file 
	is turned off. Selecting squelch mode automatically turns writing 
	off; disabling squelch automatically turns it on. (See "d" above).

	t
	If Waitnum is more than 1, wait for echoes to stop after sending 
	each Waitnum characters for period Pause.  If Waitnum==1, send at 
	1/Throttle, measured in loops of the term() function.  The 
	default values of Waitnum and Throttle provide transmission at 
	about 50 words per minute regardless of baud rate.  This is handy 
	because many remote systems cannot accept input at full speed.

	v
	View control characters as ^C.  Useful in shutting up the bloody 
	bell.  In addition to the above, v distinguishes characters with 
	the parity bit set by prepending a tilde (~).  Note: View mode is 
	distinct from view option.  This mode is reset after each command.

	w
	When sending files with the term command, send CR only at end of 
	line, and then pause until echoes from remote have stopped.  
	Useful for sending files to bulletin boards where the remote 
	needs time to prepare for the next text line.  The length of this 
	pause is controlled by the p parameter.

	x
	exit from the term function when EOF is encountered on transmitted 
	file.

	z
	Close file when ^Z is encountered while dumping the capture 
	buffer.  Otherwise ^Z is ignored.  It should be noted that ``The 
	Source'' coughs up an occasional ^Z just as the "UPI" 
	program is about to output something interesting.

5. Options used with S and R commands

	All options are reset after each command.

	b
	Batch option.  In receive, filenames are provided by the sender. 
	Pathname(s) may be specified as a batch option for file 
	reception(i.e rb /usr/cat/).  Filenames provided by the sender 
	will be appended to the specified path name.  Disk and 
	subdirectory names are excluded from the transmitted pathname(s).

	c
	Request Cyclic Redundancy Check instead of simple checksum.  This 
	option must be specified with the R function.  The receiving 
	program automatically signals the sending program if CRC is to be 
	used.  The probability of an undetected transmission error is 
	much less if CRC is used in place of arithmetic checksum.

	k
	Use 1 K byte blocks with the S and R functions.  Default block 
	length is 128.  Increases throughput when the baudrate is high, 
	relative to the response times of the channel and computers.  The 
	k option may not work properly on all systems, especially at high 
	baud rates.

	q
	Quiet option inhibits some of the status information.  Unlike some 
	other programs, quiet option is not necessary for proper file 
	file transfer at higher baudrates.

	t
	Execute the term function after file transfer(s) complete.

	v
	View the data being transmitted.  Correct data is displayed once.  
	Viewing ascii files does not interfere with correct transmission 
	at extreme baud rates, although throughput will be affected.  For 
	each sector, data is viewed once before sending/after receiving.

	y
	Yes it is OK to clobber a file already on disk.  If absent, the 
	operator is given a choice of appending to the current file (a), 
	erasing it (y) or aborting (n).

6. Parameters used with P command

	gm
	Set GOchar to m (decimal).  Default is linefeed.  (See p mode.) 
	Some remote systems accept uploads with a ? for each line.  
	Optimum operation with such a system might call for pg63 pp10000 
	pt90 ftw filename.  The first sets the go ahead character to 
	question mark, the second sets the timeout to a long delay, 
	the third sets throttle to a speed which allows the remote 
	to echo at 300 baud (assuming no tabs), and finally the 
	command to send the file with throttle and wait at end of 
	line (also eliminating the lf).  If this sounds too 
	complex you can always go back to longhand.

	em
	Set Exitchar to m (decimal).  Same format as GOchar discussed 
	above.  If defined (non-zero), term function will return when m 
	is keyboarded, and ALL other keyboarded characters are passed to 
	the remote.  If special function keys have been defined for 
	replot and exit they will still be recognized.  Otherwise, be 
	sure not to set Exitchar to something you can't keyboard!

	wn
	Set Waitnum to n.  See "w" mode for details.  Default is 1.

	tm
	Set Throttle to m.  The default value corresponds to about 80 
	words per minute sending speed.

	pm
	Set Pause to m.  When the free characters in the circular buffer 
	reach LOWATER, an XOFF is sent.  Pause controls the time which 
	must then pass without characters received before believing that 
	the other end really has obeyed the XOFF character, as opposed to 
	the sometimes lengthy Compuserve hitches in the getalong. If 
	Pause is too short, it is possible that a lurch in output will be 
	interpreted as acknowledgement of the XOFF, only to have more 
	characters arrive whilst yam is occupied dumping the buffer to 
	disk.  When this happens, unfortunate characters are routed to 
	the proverbial bit bucket, and you can retry the download as the 
	timesharing service increments the connect charge.  The default 
	value seems suitable for Source over Tymnet and BBS systems.  
	Pause is also the echo wait period used with the w mode, as well 
	as the timeout for p mode. Some bulletin board programs require a 
	very long pause when accepting files with the p or w mode.

7. Replot Commands

	Commands within replot consist of a single character. Replot maps 
	uppercase, lowercase, and control characters together in decoding 
	commands.

	b
	Display beginning of buffer.

	k
	Kill entire buffer contents and return.

	r,BS
	Display previous page (some overlap is provided).


	SP
	Display the next page.

	/
	Accept a search string, terminated by return.  Search through the 
	buffer starting at the current location for the first (next) 
	instance of that string (matches either case).  Display page 
	starts with that line.  If the search is unsuccessful, ring bell 
	and jump to the beginning of the buffer.

	n
	Search for next occurrence of the previously entered search string.

	p
	Backup one line and redisplay.

	LF
	Advance one line.

	x
	Exit after displaying the last page of buffer contents. This 
	restores the screen and keyboard to the same state they were in 
	before replot was entered.  X allows you to see where you were if 
	you were in the midst of keyboarding a command to the remote.  
	For example, suppose you are typing in a line of commands and you 
	need to "thumb back" through the remote's output for some vital 
	nugget of information.  (After you enter a 20 line email message, 
	NOW Compuserve asks you for the 8 digit account number to mail it 
	to!) So you hit some Control V's until you see it on the screen.  
	Now you can't remember whether you typed a space after the last 
	part of you command to the remote.  No sweat, just exit replot 
	with x and you'll see just where you were (But don't forget that 
	number!) X may not redisplay the entire page contents if the host 
	has been sending escape sequences in the last page.

8. Special files

	There are 3 special files used with YAM.  Actual file names are 
	defined in YAMSYS.H with the defaults being "YAMCFG.T", 
	"YAMHELP.T" and "YAMPHONE.T".  YAM will search all directorys in 
	the default search path to find these files.  The data from the 
	first sucessful pathname search is used. 

YAMCFG.T
	This file is the startup configuration file.  It contains the 
	signon prompt,  initial serial port definition, definition of the 
	RXNONO string, xon-xoff parameters, and others depending on the 
	implementation. 

YAMHELP.T
	This file contains a summary of commands and is displayed by the 
	"h[elp]" command.

YAMPHONE.T
	This is the phone list file used by the CALL command.   Call 
	searches each line of this file until it finds a match.  It then 
	configures the modem port as defined by the parameters following 
	the phone number.  The phone number must be delimted by a <TAB> 
	character.  Modem baud rate is defined by a lower case 'b' 
	followed by a number.  Several letters following the baud rate 
	define the number of stop bits(S1, S2), parity none, even or 
	odd(PN,PE,PO), and the number of data bits(D7,D8). The flags 
	field define optional flags which may be turned on. At the time 
	of this writing only the Igrnx flag is defined.  This will set or 
	reset the i flag as defined in the "ei" command.


9. Sample YAM Session

	A sample session on MS-DOS might be:
	
	C>YAM			invoke yam
	b 9200;b:		Set 9.6 kb, Change to b disk
	dir yam*.*		List files and calculate xmsn time
	sb yam*.*		Send them to a system supporting the
				YAM batch mode
	call hydepark		Call the number found in phonelist
	user data		Enter a message, etc.
	^E			exit from term mode

	ftp letter		Open 'letter' and send to bbs, using prompt 
				and throttle modes to slow transmission so 
				the remote system won't drop characters.  YAM 
				remains in T(erm) after the file is sent.
	xmodem s foo.bqr	Command host to download a file

	^E
	rt secret.tqp		Download the file using MODEM7 protocol, then 
				back to term function

	dir			command to list directory on remote system
	^R pause ^R		Flip back two pages to first part of directory 
				listed previously
	CR			Back to term function
	user data		More keyboarding with remote, logoff
	^E			exit (if CDO defined, term will exit by itself)
	bye			Drop DTR so modem won't answer calls, Return 
				to DOS

10. Notes

	When operating with a timesharing system and/or through network or 
	satellite links, considerable delays in transmission and responce 
	to blocks may severely reduce throughput of an FTP (file transfer 
	protocol).  The k option causes the s command to use 1024 byte 
	blocks, rather than the standard 128.  At high baud rates, this 
	reduces the protocol related overhead up to 87 per cent, 
	depending on file length, by reducing the number of blocks which
	must be sent and acknowledged by a factor of 8.  1024 byte 
	blocks are selected by the sender.  An STX at the 
	beginning of each block (otherwise SOH for 128 bytes) 
	indicates this block is 1k long.  Pathnames are always 
	sent with 128 byte blocks. Buffering problems on some 
	timesharing systems may mitigate against use of 1k blocks 
	at high baudrates.  Files transmitted from Unix to CP/M 
	will be padded with ^Z characters as necessary to reach a 
	length divisable by 128.

	CP/M files sent with 1k blocks may not compare identically with 
	their originals due to the addition of up to seven extra 128 byte 
	sectors (padded with CPMEOF).

	Readiness to receive sectors with Cyclic Redundancy Check (2  
	bytes) instead of the usual additive checksum is indicated by a 
	0103 (ASCII "C") for initial "naks" instead of 025. CRC option is 
	highly recommended.  It is the default when using batch mode 
	and/or 1k blocks.

	File transmission is compatible with MODEM7 in single file,  
	standard block length mode.  File transmission may be aborted by 
	sending a SEQUENCE of CAN (^X) characters.  Each character 
	keyboarded will cause readline() to return a TIMEOUT error, thus 
	regaining keyboard control relatively easily.

	Maximum baudrate possible without errors using the t(erm)  
	function depends on the computer and particular yam  
	implementation, but usually is 9600 baud.

	Use these numbers for comparison.  Your mileage and range may 
	differ depending on clock speed, circuit distance and RFI/EMI.  
	California estimate lower.

	Quiet mode is not necessary for proper operation at 19kb,  
	although it does increase throughput slightly.  View option (S 
	and R commands) does not decrease maximum baud rate, although 
	throughput is obviously affected according to the ratio of 
	terminal speed to communications rate.

	Printer operation with bios calls or view mode substantially  
	reduces the highest baudrate possible with the term function  
	without losing characters (independent of actual printer speed).  
	The term function will send XOFF to prevent buffer overflow if 
	the printer is on, or if a receive file is in use.

	In the term function, use of the circular buffer provides some 
	advantages.

	Incoming data may come in at a rate higher than the display and/or 
	printer.  Tab expansion for the display does not compromise this 
	ability.

	The user may decide to save a timesharing session on the disk 
	AFTER it has started (or possibly even finished) as long as 
	the buffer pointers have not wrapped around.

	The same ability also applies to the printer.  The printer need 
	not be as fast as the host as long as the Tortoise is allowed to 
	catch up.

	Received data may be redisplayed (replot command).

	At high speeds, the display will fall behind the incoming data, as 
	storing of raw host data into the buffer takes precedence over 
	all else.  As a result, a defective or incorrectly programmed 
	port which sources data at high speed can lockout the keyboard.  
	If yam "goes away" when entering the term function, this may be 
	the cause.

	The t and z modes affecting dumping of captured data take effect 
	when the circular buffer is written to the receive file, not as 
	the characters are first received from the data port.

	The append option (available if receiving filename where filename 
	exists) operates by by utilizing the append option of the C open 
	command.

11. Downloading Files from Unix(TM) Systems

	To download files from Unix systems with sb, invoke sb(1) to send 
	the desired files and then use the yam ``r[yt]'' command.  On 
	Unix type:

	sb file ...

	Then exit term with ^E and give

	ry

	and file transfers will commence.

	If the files are long, and/or if the baudrate is limited, you can 
	save time by squeezing them first with sq(1).

	Versions of the BDS C programs SQ, TYPE, and USQ are available for 
	Unix systems.  The CP/M version of USQ supports a -n option which 
	will expand Unix NL's to CR/LF. The Unix version -n flag 
	suppresses carriage returns.

	If a file or set of files are to be transported between Unix  
	systems with yam, it is helpful to place them in a tar(1) archive 
	(and possibly squeeze the archive) before transmission.  This 
	procedure will preserve the modification times and avoid adding 
	^Z characters to the ends of files.  The -k option of sb will 
	select 1 kb block length rather than the standard 128 bytes for 
	improved throughput at high baudrates.  Currently this does not 
	work at 9600 baud with the Z100 under MSB.

	Consult the sb.1 manual entry for more information.

12. Uploading Files to Unix(TM) Systems

	On Unix systems, files may be uploaded with rb(1). See the rb.1 
	manual entry for more information.

13. Error Correcting File Transfer with Other(UGH) Remote Systems

	If the host system has YAM, XYAM, MODEM, XMODEM, tmodem, umodem, 
	or something compatible, you can upload files with the s command 
	on your computer and the corresponding r command on the remote.  
	Newer versions of some of these programs support Cyclic 
	Redundancy Check as an alternative to the simple checksum used by 
	the original Ward Christensen protocol.  CRC is much better at 
	detecting errors and I recommend its use where available.

	Unfortunately, this protocol is not implemented on the popular 
	timesharing services The Source and Compuserve.  It is often 
	possible to upload files using the F command, perhaps with one or 
	more modes.  Your chances of success improve if you set "enab 
	flow" when connecting to Telenet. If using Tymnet, type ^R^X just 
	before the host computer name to enable flow control with XOFF 
	and XON.  It often helps to use "half duplex" when connecting to 
	the computer.

	Yam4 implements the Compuserve `A' protocol which is usable only 
	on Compuserve's own network.

	The determined hacker will divine alternative ways to transfer 
	files by a close examination of the rest of this document.

14. BUGS

	Yam does not trap any escape sequences from the computer which can 
	lock up the keyboard or display.  If yam appears to be locked up, 
	check the terminal by itself to see if perhaps it is wedged.

	Not all commands are implemented on all versions.

	When YAM is used with a terminal (or terminal emulation) which 
	accepts commands to transmit information to the host (screen 
	dump, cursor position, indent, etc.), the characters so generated 
	may cause YAM to do strange things.  The most common 
	manifestation of this is in replot mode, where the automatically 
	generated characters may cause YAM to exit replot.

	Yam gets its input in term() mode from low level bios functions.
	This was done for speed but has the side effect of disableing many
	keyboard re-definition utilities.

	readbaud() must return a valid #.  Otherwise baudrate will be 0 
	and routines which use it(especially dir) will fail with a divide 
	by 0 error.

	sb *.* will report an error when it encounters a subdirectory.  It 
	recovers and the error message can be ignored.

	rb pathname may send a pathname NAK to the other system before it 
	is ready, depending on the speed of the host.  This is especially 
	true when using a ram disk to receive files.

	break on control-c may not be recognized properly if DOS BREAK
	ON is set.
