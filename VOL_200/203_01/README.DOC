                YAM converted for use on MS-DOS by

     This version of YAM was converted from both the YAM for BDS-C
     CP/M-80 version and the CI-C86 CP/M-86 version by Paul
     Homchick.  Many of the features found in each were kept,
     although a large number have been deleted.  Deletions
     consisted mostly of stuff which was incompatible with MS-DOS,
     things which were useless and things which never did work.
     If nothing else this revision should be much more readable as
     many comments were added and all modules were reformatted in
     a consistent manner.  

     YAM is admittedly terse, difficult to remember how to use and
     not friendly.  It is, however, extremely versatile and
     powerful.  Seasoned YAM users will no doubt be able to easily
     add their favorite customizations.  

     YAM was converted for several reasons:
     1) There was a need for a public domain modem program of
        reasonable capability, written in a decent language.
     2) for the fun of it.  

     This program takes special pains not to draw pretty pictures
     or muck up the crt attributes set up by the user.  As a
     result it uses only dumb terminal characteristics and should
     be easy to port to other systems with minimal modification.

     I have verified at one time or another that all of the
     commands work, but as in any software program, there will
     always be bugs.  I have sucessfully transferred files at 9600
     kbaud in batch mode to and from a CPM-80 system running YAM
     written in BDS-C.  I have also verified the MODEM7 single
     file transfer utilities work with other MODEM7 file transfer
     programs.  Several things have not been tested, so use at
     your own risk.  Some of these are the COMPUSERVE protocol
     handler, XMODEM, RESTRICTED, STATLINE, DEFBYTL, LOGFILE
     modes.  

     Documentation files are supplied in ASCII form so anyone can
     edit and modify them as needed.  Suggested print method for
     MSDOS is: print <filenam.doc> /p54 /l5 /f.  Batch files
     supplied with this distribution are only documented here.  

     yamcc.bat - complile all 'C' and assembly modules for YAM
     cc.bat    - used to complie a single module.  It appends YAM and
                 .C to the file name and re-directs the error ouput to
                 a file errx.  For example cc 5 compiles yam5.c and
                 directs the error output to err5.
    ccl.bat    - compiles the file as with cc.bat, but invokes the linker
                 if the compile was successful.
    ll.bat     - invokes the linker to create yam.exe
    yamlist    - list of files to link.  used by ll.bat
    makearc.bat- makes archive of all needed yam files.
