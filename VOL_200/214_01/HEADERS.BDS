DIOR.C   
DIO.CRL 
DIO.H   

IO redirection library and header from BDS C and Van Nuys Toolkit, 
by Eugene H. Mallory.

Minor modification: 
	avoid CR-CR pair before LF by patch in putchar() and by adding
		declaration of _putc_last in DIO.H;

TYPER-R.C   
TYPER-R.COM 

Line editor that handles typing not suitable for a word processor, 
eg, filling out forms, envelopes, short notes, etc.

The program offers control of full two-dimensional movement of the 
printhead, for printers with reverse line feed.  It is set
for Diablo conventions.

Based upon TYPER, by H. G. Lord.

Rewrite of TYPE20, by sfk, W. Earnest, and others.

Restored user number prefixes and introduced recognition of <du:> form
	(new versions of DEFFx.CRL and WILDEXP).
Introduced command_line options and flags toggled or set through them.
Revised dochar() and xxxx_putchar() for efficiency.
Sort filelist before display.
Changed format of display, to accomodate printing.
Option to add formfeed if needed to maintain phase of fanfold paper.
OUT_BDOS option, so can print with cp/m ^p; route input also through bdos.
General changes in code.

Examples of option settings:

	option = -S		option = -T		option = -U

	display 19 lines	display all file	display all file
	no pausing		no pausing		pause at page/file
