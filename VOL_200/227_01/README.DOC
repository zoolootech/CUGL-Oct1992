This disk contains no object files. Sorry to all programmers without the
macro assembler, but there wasn't enough space. Object files also cause
problems when converting the disk to different formats. So I decided not to
include them.

*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

There are two poor example programs on the disk:
1. A program that draws mandelbrot sets, if you have lots of time. Its named
   frktal.c (from german "Fraktal"). Please do not reboot your computer
   during the first 5 minutes, the program needs this time to draw the first
   points.

2. A simple turtle graphic demo program, named turtle.c. This program uses
   only a small subset of the available function calls, but it was written
   by a nine-year old child. As you can see, turtle graphic is easy.

The compete documentation is included as nroff source file in "GRAF.S" and
as pure ASCII-text in file "GRAF.TXT".
