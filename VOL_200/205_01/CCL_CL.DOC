 CCL-CL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format:

     ccl-cl [ < [filename[.ext]]

Purpose:

Depending on the operating system or the network communications protocol, the
line termination sequence varies.

During exchange of files with operating systems other than MS-DOS, it is 
possible that you will receive a text file with an improper line termination 
sequence.  This may be confirmed by either (1) verifying the improper line
termination sequence by dumping the file using debug or a filedump utility, or 
by (2) viewing it in an editor (such as vi or WordStar) which shows control
characters.

The CCL-CL filter terminates the lines properly for use with MS-DOS.  CCL-CL 
takes its input from stdin and converts all [CR][CR][LF] sequences to [CR][LF]
sequences.  

Example:

Convert the file named bbs.doc, which came from a Bulletin Board system, to
MS-DOS format and save it in the file named result.

     ccl-cl < bbs.doc > result
