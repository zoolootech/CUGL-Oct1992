MIRACL - IBM PC/MS-DOS Version 2.0
ADDRESS- M.Scott, N.I.H.E., Ballymun, Dublin, Ireland

This version includes several improvements over version 1.0.

Version 1.1

    Faster integer roots program (speeds up deciph).
    Basic flash arithmetic now twice as fast.
    Flash roots and powers, exps and logs, and full complement of
    trig functions. See bnflsh1/2/3.c.
    Faster 'pi' program.

Version 1.11

    Certain minor I/O bugs fixed.

Version 1.2

    NEW! MIRACL RATIONAL CALCULATOR program - RATCALC.EXE

Version 1.21

    More bugs hunted out. Integer roots program rewritten - again!
    New 32016 version of bnmuldv.c (from Dudley Long, RAL)

Version 1.3

    Faster trig functions. New Hyperbolic functions. New improved RATCALC
    program, with more features

Version 1.31

    Header files rearranged and renamed. Certain routines renamed.

Version 1.32

    IBM PC 8087 support included. The inevitable bugs found and dealt with.
    Borlands Turbo C supported.

Version 1.33

    RATCALC tidied up. Full Colour and 40 column versions supported (see
    comments in source listing).

Version 1.34

    Okamoto's Public Key Encryption  programs improved. Minor modifications
    to xgcd(). Documentation tidied up. Various optimizations - RATCALC 15%
    faster.

Version 1.4
    
    Basic flash operations function 'flop' rewritten to allow greater range
    of functions. Up to 30% speed-up acheived for exps, logs and trig 
    functions.

Version 2.0

    New suite of factoring programs, Pollard's p-1, Williams p+1 and Lenstra's
    Elliptic curve method. Also an implementation of the Quadratic sieve 
    algorithm - very fast! Header files reorganised. Certain number theoretic
    functions added.

Version 2.01

    New version for Acorn Archimedes 32-bit RISC micro. This calculates 1000!
    in just 10 seconds - faster than a VAX!. New 80386 version.

Version 2.02   14/12/88

    Experimental C++ Headers now  included.  I/O  routines  modified  to
    allow 'big' number conversion to/from pure binary form - useful for
    practical implementations of Public Key systems. 40% faster at
    finding large primes.
 
Note - The MIRACL library is written in standard C and has been tested  on 
several  combinations  of  computer  and  compiler.  It should work on any 
system which supports C as defined by Kernighan and Richie.  The author is 
interested to hear of any problems that arise with other configurations.  

Remember - not all compilers are  perfect!  MIRACL  contains  work-arounds 
which were necessary to circumvent bugs in certain compilers.  

Known problems 

None
