        Dear Mr. Ward,

                              Data Exchange Format


             I've just received the last C User's Journal.  As  I  could
        see  in  the letters coloumn, you have some first candidates for
        the exchange format library programs.

             This brings me to send you this  packet:  It  contains  the
        first  draft  of  my  version  of  such an utility. It is mostly
        written according to my draft format description I've  send  you
        some  time  ago. As such it includes some features that make the
        format more portable than a plain cpio  or  tar  implementation.
        This  features include e. g. the ability to do tab expansion and
        filename conversion.  Note  that  most  of  the  extensions  are
        optional and disabled unless actived by a command line switch.

             Although  it  doesn't  implement  a  plain cpio format, the
        utility is able to read 4and5 4write5 cpio disks. So you are able to
        use it with Unix disks you've gotten from anyone.

             The program is not a very, very simple one but it uses only
        standard C and  should  compile  under  most  compiler/operating
        system  pairs. It has been developed under Unix (pcc) and passed
        a short test under the following environments: MS-DOS  (MSC5.0),
        MS-DOS            (Turbo-C1.5),           MS-DOS(Lattice-C3.00),
        MS-DOS(Datalight-C2.23to3.11), Starsys (native-compiler).

             Note that the program is not really complete today. I  only
        send  this  version  so  that you can take it into consideration
        when prooving exchange format utilities. There is  also  GEnoHF  new
        documentation  included  on  the disk. Please look at the source
        module for further details.

             The loader utilities haven't been upgraded  since  my  last
        letter.  This will be done in the near future. They will receive
        a different user interface (but still command line).

             The enclosed disk contains my whole  development  directory
        (except  binaries)  at  its  current  state.  The  program I was
        talking about is cugcpio.c. It needs the header  file  environ.h
        to set the correct execution environment conviguration. No other
        files are required.

             At last a request: please give me a little  feedback  about



        my contribution and how do you think it will fit in the exchange
        format. This keeps me on the right  way  and  perhaps  helps  me
        saving time if you think it's better to cancel my development.



        Sincerely yours,
