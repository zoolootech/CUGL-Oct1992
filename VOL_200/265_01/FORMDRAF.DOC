chapters:
1. introduction
2. exchange media
3. archive format
4. implementation
5. usage of archive/unarchive utilities



- usage of unarchive utility: 
  read  file start-sector byte-length
	file is the name of the sequential output file
	start-sector is the first sector read form
	sector length is computed using the byte length

- usage of archive utility:
  write file start-sector
        file is the name of the sequential input file
	start-sector is the first sector written to
	the byte length is determined by the length of the input
	file. no input file may be larger than a single disk

- general archive format
  o ASCII code set. System using other code sets must convert
    the data when reading and writing exchange format disks.

  o sequential file organization

  o no file may be splited across different archives

- header format
  o cpio header ???

  o filename has to be constructed on rules based on KERMIT:
    - digits and upper case alphabetics (0x30 - 0x39, 0x41 - 0x5a)
    - at most a single period
    - at most 8 charactes before and 3 characters after the period
    - NO device or system specific information (like drives or path names)

- data format
  o printable characters (execpt newline) only

  o tabs are expanded when writing archives

  o newline is represented by a single LF character (as in unix).
    newline conversion takes place when reading and writing exchange
    format disks under operating systems with different conventions

- storage media
  o any media physicaly writable by cug, at least 8", 5.25", 3.5"
    diskettes and 9 track tapes
