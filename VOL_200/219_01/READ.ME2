     What's on this disk?  It goes like this:

	READ.ME2	This notice.

	A65.DOC		The manual for the 6502 and 65C02 cross-assemblers.
			This file can be printed with the following command
			line under CP/M-80:

				A>pip lst:=a65.doc[t8]

	A65.H		The source files for the 6502 cross-assembler.  The
	A65.C		file A65.H also contains compile, assemble, and link
	A65EVAL.C	instructions for all compilers that I have used with
	A65UTIL.C	the package or that users have told me how to use with
			the package.

	TEST65.ASM	The entire instruction set of the 6502 CPU to use in
			testing the 6502 cross-assembler.

	A65C.H		The source files for the 65C02 cross-assembler.  The
	A65C.C		file A65C.H also contains compile, assemble, and link
	A65CEVAL.C	instructions for all compilers that I have used with
	A65CUTIL.C	the package or that users have told me how to use with
			the package.

	TEST65C.ASM	The entire instruction set of the 65C02 processor to
			use in testing the 65C02 cross-assembler.

	A48.DOC		The manual for the 8048 cross-assembler.  This file
			can be printed with the following command line under
			CP/M-80:

				A>pip lst:=a48.doc[t8]

	A48.H		The source files for the 8048 cross-assembler.  The
	A48.C		file A48.H also contains compile, assemble, and link
	A48EVAL.C	instructions for all compilers that I have used with
	A48UTIL.C	the package or that users have told me how to use with
			the package.

	TEST48.ASM	The entire instruction set of the 8048 processor to
			use in testing the 8048 cross-assembler.

     I not only wrote these pieces of software originally and rewrote them in
"portable" C for all of you UNIX and IBM-PC users out there, but I am also the
librarian for the disk, and as such, I am responsible for maintaining the
packages.  I can only do this with YOUR help.  During the re-write, I noticed a
few bugs in the BDS C versions.  These were never reported to me by any of you
users, so I never knew to fix them.  PLEASE report bugs to me promptly so that
I can get them fixed.  I am only a letter or a phone call away.

     The lists of compile, assemble, and link instructions for the packages are
limited by my personal experience if YOU do not contribute.  In particular, I
have no access to an AT&T UNIX system (only clones of BSD 4.2 UNIX) nor to
IBM-PC C compilers other than Eco-C88, Microsoft C 3.0, and DeSmet C.  I need
YOU to tell me how to use the package with these systems and others.

     Once the first cross-assembler (the 6801 package) is written, adapting it
to other 8-bit or 4-bit processors (like the 1805A) is easy.  In fact, I once
adapted one of the BDS C versions to a 12-bit processor (the PIC1650).  It only
takes a couple of evenings for me to do it. What processors should be next, if
any?  Get your votes in, either to me or to the Users' Group.  Otherwise, the
selection of cross-assemblers will reflect only my needs, which at the moment
are taking off in a bizarre direction.

     Having the author double as the librarian allows this disk to be a living,
growing entity, but its growth will be stunted by my lack of resources if YOU
do not contribute your share.  Speak up, for everybody's sake!
