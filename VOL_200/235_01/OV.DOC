     1.0 INTRODUCTION

     1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE

     This is a brief (and informal) document describing the
     installation and usage of OverView, a file maintenance
     utility.  This document does not completely describe all the
     features and functions of OverView, but it does contain
     enough information to get you started.  Once you begin using
     OverView, you can learn more about how it operates from the
     on-line help facility and by experimenting with the various
     commands.


     1.2 WHAT IS OVERVIEW?

     OverView is a file maintenance utility that enables you to
     perform common file operations (copying, renaming, erasing,
     etc) with easy, straight forward commands.  OverView removes
     the guess work from file operations by displaying the files
     on your disk in a tabular format that is constantly updated
     in response to your changes.  OverView's command menus speed
     up time consuming disk clean-up and maintenance sessions
     because your current options are always at your finger tips.

     OverView is a file maintenance utility, plain and simple. It
     has the capability to run DOS commands, but it is not
     designed to be a full featured DOS shell that simplifies all
     DOS operations.  Nor is OverView a memory resident program
     that can be called up via a "hot" key.  These constraints
     were designed into OverView to make it as simple and
     straight forward as possible.

     OverView will be of most benefit to people who have a hard
     disk in their computer.  OverView will work just fine on a
     floppy disk only system, but the file maintenance needs of
     floppy only systems are not as great as hard disk systems.
     Few people have multiple directories and hundreds or
     thousands of files on floppy disk systems.

     In addition to the standard file maintenance features (copy,
     rename, erase, etc) OverView has many powerful features
     including:

     * Supports from 1 to 4 windows allowing access to as many as
       4 directories at the same time.

     * Directory tree display.

     * A show-all function that allows all files on the current
       disk to be accessed as easily as the files in the current
       directory.

     * Full screen interface with user selectable display colors
       (video attributes).

     * On-line help available whenever and wherever OverView is
       waiting for user input.

     * Full source code is provided.  OverView is written in a
       combination of Microsoft C (version 4) and Microsoft MASM.


     1.3 WHY ANOTHER FILE MAINTENANCE UTILITY?

     If you are at all familiar with the microcomputer software
     marketplace, you can probably think of one or two or maybe
     even a few already existing file maintenance utilities.
     That's basically the position I was in when I started
     developing OverView; I knew a little about a couple of
     commercial utilities and had tried a few of the shareware or
     user-supported file maintenance utilities, but I wasn't
     really happy with any of them.

     During the time that I was developing OverView, I became
     aware of many more utilities like it than I'd thought
     existed.  If I had found one that worked the way I wanted it
     to work, or I had found one that supplied the source code so
     I could change it, I would never have finished OverView.

     OverView contains most of the functions that I wanted in a
     file maintenance program.  They may or may not be the
     functions that you want or like.  For that reason I am
     distributing the full source code with the product so others
     like myself can customize it if they wish.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     3.0 INSTALLATION

     3.1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     OverView requires an IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible system to
     work properly.  In addition, version 2.0 or greater of
     PC-DOS or MS-DOS is required.

     To improve display speed, OverView writes directly to the
     video screen memory of your computer.  OverView works well
     with then IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), Color
     Graphics Adapter (CGA), and compatibles.

     In addition OverView has worked correctly on the systems
     I've tried that have IBM compatible Enhanced Graphics
     Adapters (EGA).  Unfortunately I cannot guarantee it will
     work properly on all EGA compatible systems since I did not
     have access to one while developing the software.


     3.2 FILE SETUP

     The installation process is actually quite simple.  There
     are only two files required to run OverView.  They are
     OV.EXE (the program itself) and OV.HLP (the help file).

     If your system has a DOS PATH command setup, simply copy
     these two files into one of the directories identified in
     the PATH command.  If you have a hard disk system, but you
     haven't setup a PATH command, you should read about it in
     the DOS manual or get someone knowledgeable to help you set
     one up.

     OverView must be able to locate the OV.HLP file when you ask
     for on-line help.  OverView will first look in the current
     directory for OV.HLP;  if it is not there OverView will then
     look in the directories specified by the PATH command. If
     the help file still can't be located, you will be prompted
     to supply the location of OV.HLP.

     If you are running a floppy only system, I recommend that
     you copy both OV.EXE and OV.HLP to your system disk (or
     disks if you have more than one system disk).  The OV.HLP
     file is not accessed unless you actually request help, so it
     could be left off if you are really short on disk space.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     4.0 GETTING STARTED

     You start OverView by typing OV and pressing return at a DOS
     prompt.  There are no command line parameters or arguments
     to supply.  OverView will display an initial start up screen
     and read the directory information of the files in the
     current drive/directory.  Press any key and OverView will
     show the main file display.

     There are three areas on the main file display;  the header
     area, the file name area, and the menu area.  The header
     area at the top of the screen contains information about the
     current drive, the current directory, and OverView options.

     The file name area displays a sorted list of the file names
     in the current directory.  If there are more files in the
     directory than will fit on one screen, you can use the arrow
     keys or the PgUp/PgDn/Home/End keys to display the other
     file names.

     Many of the OverView commands work on the current file.  The
     current file is identified by being the only highlighted
     name in the file name area.  The four arrow keys can be used
     to select a different current file.  The highlighted bar
     over the file name is sometimes called the file pointer.

     The menu area shows what commands can currently be
     performed.  The next to last line of the screen displays a
     menu of the allowable command names while the very last line
     displays a short message about the currently highlighted
     command.  You select a command from the menu in one of two
     ways;  either use the space/backspace/tab keys to highlight
     the desired command and press return, or press the key that
     is the first letter of the desired command.  The ESC key can
     be used to exit a submenu without selecting any of the menu
     choices.

     In addition to the menu, some OverView commands are
     performed by the function keys.  Function key usage is
     described in the on-line help.

     OverView works in what I hope is an obvious and intuitive
     manner.  The best way to learn it is to use it.  You can
     access OverView's on-line help any time it is waiting for
     input by pressing the F1 function key.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     5.0 CUSTOMIZATION

     You can customize the colors (display attributes) that
     OverView uses with the OTHER - DEFINE - COLORS command.
     There are seven categories of text display that can be
     independently selected.  In addition, there are separate
     settings maintained for color and monochrome monitors
     (selected by the current video mode when OverView is
     started).

     If you have a color display adapter that does not produce
     video "snow" when writing directly to video memory, you can
     speed up OverView's screen handling by disabling "snow"
     checking with the OTHER - DEFINE - SNOW command.  If you're
     not sure if your system creates "snow" or not, try disabling
     it - you will quickly know if it needs to be re-enabled.

     If you change the color and/or "snow" settings, you should
     also use the OTHER - DEFINE - WRITE command to make the
     settings permanent.  OverView directly updates its own
     OV.EXE file with the DEFINE settings you have selected - it
     does not keep a separate parameter or initialization file -
     nor does it require a separate setup program.  However, this
     requires that OverView be able to find its own OV.EXE file,
     and the file must not be write protected.  With DOS version
     3.0 and greater, OverView knows exactly where it was started
     from and updates that file.  When running under DOS 2.x,
     OverView will first look in the current directory, then
     search the directories specified by the PATH command for the
     OV.EXE file.  If the OV.EXE file can't be located, you will
     be prompted to supply the pathname to use.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     6.0 HELPFUL HINTS

     This section contains several hints on effectively using
     OverView for your file maintenance tasks.  I suggest that
     you briefly read over these hints now (pay attention to the
     first one!) and then experiment with OverView somewhat
     before really examining what these hints describe.

     * The ESC key returns you to the top level menu for the
       current function (file name display, Dir tree, View, Help,
       etc).  If you get into a submenu by accident and there is
       no Quit selection, press the ESC key to get to the top
       menu level.

     * When performing some function on all TAGGED files (copy
       tagged, rename tagged, erase tagged, etc), the ESC, ^U, or
       ^C key can be used to interrupt the process. Striking one
       of these keys in a TAGGED file operation causes the
       message "Interrupt?" to be displayed.  Respond Y to stop
       the operation, N to continue.

     * When you are prompted for a response in a pop up dialog
       box (for example, LOGIN to a new dir), the response you
       give can be edited with the Ins, Del, <- (backspace), <-
       (left arrow), and -> keys up until the time you press the
       Enter key to end the input.

     * When the current DIR tree is displayed (by the DIR
       command), the current directory is initially highlighted.
       You can switch to a new directory by using the cursor keys
       to highlight another directory (the Home key goes to the
       root dir).  OverView does not actually "login" to the new
       directory until you select the LOGIN option from the DIR
       menu.  As you move the highlighted dir pointer around the
       tree, the actual current directory will be displayed in a
       different color/video attribute to remind you which
       directory you are logged in to.  This is the directory to
       which OverView returns if you select the Quit option from
       the DIR menu.

     * Don't start a Terminate and/but Stay Resident (TSR)
       utility from OverView's COMMAND, INTERPRETER, or XECUTE
       commands.  If you do this, the TSR will be loaded above
       OverView in memory.  When you exit OverView, a "hole" will
       be left in memory where OverView used to reside.  This is
       true not only of OverView, but many other programs that
       also give you access to DOS.  Note that the DOS PRINT
       command is a TSR utility that remains in memory after
       being loaded the first time.  If you are going to use DOS
       PRINT from within OverView, make sure you execute PRINT at
       least once before starting OverView.

     * The SELECT SHOWALL command is a powerful feature of
       OverView.  Some examples of its possible uses are:

       - Erase all the .BAK files on drive C by selecting all
         files on C (SELECT SHOWALL), tagging all files with the
         extension .BAK (TAG NAME), and then erasing all tagged
         files (ERASE TAGGED).

       - Turn off the Archive attribute of selected files so the
         DOS BACKUP program will not copy them to disk.  Select
         all files (SELECT SHOWALL), tag all modified files (TAG
         MODIFIED), use the SELECT TAGGED command to display only
         tagged files, untag (F2 key) the files which are to be
         backed up - leaving only modified files not to backed up
         still tagged, finally use the ATTRIB TAGGED command to
         turn off the Archive attribute of the tagged files.

     * The OverView WINDOW commands allow you to work with from 1
       to 4 directories on the screen at a time.  This feature is
       quite useful when working with two or more directories at
       the same time.  For example, when copying a set of files
       from a hard disk to a floppy, or when moving files from
       one directory to another.

     * Subdirectory names are displayed with a \ following the
       name so they are easily identified.  The F3 function key
       switches to the parent of the current directory.  The F4
       function key switches to the subdirectory currently at the
       file pointer.

     * The F5 and F6 function keys move the file pointer to the
       next or previous tagged file, respectively.

     * This version of OverView has a limit of 1024 files that it
       can keep track of per window.  If you need to increase
       that, you can change the source code to do so.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     7.0 THE FUTURE OF OVERVIEW

     OverView is an experiment in "shareware" or "user-supported
     software."  Bringing it to this point has required a
     considerable investment of my free time.  Most of the
     features I initially set out to include are completed, along
     with many that I thought of during its development.  Several
     suggestions that friends made have also been included.

     As it currently stands, I find OverView useful enough that I
     use it every day, and some of my friends say they do to.
     Like most program development projects however, there are
     numerous ideas and enhancements that are not incorporated in
     this version due to time constraints and a desire to get the
     product out.

     If anyone brings a problem to my attention that I somehow
     missed during testing, I will attempt to fix the problem and
     distribute updated versions.  However, I intend to wait and
     see if this experiment in "shareware" is economically
     successful before I commit major amounts of my time to
     adding new features and functions (and more complete
     documentation).

     Thank you for using and supporting OverView!
