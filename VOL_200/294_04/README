	Three Dimensional Reconstruction Of Medical
	Images from Serial Slices - CT, MRI, Ultrasound


   These programs process a set of slices images (scans) for one
   patient. It outputs two sets of files containing nine predefined
   views of bony surfaces. One set contains distance values and
   the other gradient values.

   The distance values are used as 3-D spatial topographic surface
   coordinate maps for geometrical analysis of the scanned object.

   The gradient values are used for rendering the surface maps on
   CRT displays for subjective viewing where perception of small
   surface details is important.

The files DBO.out, DRL.out and DRE.out are 3-D surface
images 256 x 256 (or slightly fewer lines) with 8 bits
per pixel.  These are 3-D reconstruction images obtained
from CT scans using the grad.c program supplied by the
authors.

The data file, "CTBILD.001", is a sample CT scan slice
from a Siemens Somatom 2 CT scanner.  It has a header 
block of 512 bytes, followed by 256 image lines.  Each
image line has 256 elements (pixels or voxels, if you
prefer).  Each pixel consists of 16 bits or 2 bytes.  Of
these, only the low order 11 bits contain gray scale
data.  The high order 5 bits (or in the case of other
CT scanners, the high order 4 bits) may be ignored.

There are several CTBILD files on this disk. These comprise
a set of serial slices (7 from a set of 64 or more) from a
single patient.  These serial slices may reconstructed into
a set of 3D reconstruction images using our software.
  
If you are interested in other CT scan data sets in
testing or experimenting with this software, Let us know.
We are pleased to help supply these, if practical.
Contact the authors, as listed below, for more information
on 3-D reconstruction imaging for the PC (and other 
platforms).  Keep us informed on your progress, as we
are most pleased to hear from you and share our work in
biomedical image processing....
