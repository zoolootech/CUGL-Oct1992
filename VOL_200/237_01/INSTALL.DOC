     The GRAD library in the distribution file is for HGA in full mode and 
EPSON FX-80 or compatible printers (including IBM graphics printer). If your 
system configuration is the same as the default configuration, you may skip 
the next section and read the section "Compiling the GRAD sample programs".

INSTALLING GRAD LIBRARY

     To install GRAD library, you need the LIB (library manager) program from 
the Microsoft C compiler utility diskette or compatible ones. If you do not 
have the program, you may still use GRAD library. Read the last section on how 
to use GRAD library without installation.

     If you are using HGA in half mode, you should extract the file from 
HERCHALF.ARC and then type the commad:

        LIB gradlib,-+calcaddr,,gradlib

     If you are using CGA, you should extract the files from COLOR.ARC and 
then type the command:

        LIB gradlib,-+calcaddr-+plottype-+ftable,,gradlib

     Similarly, if you want to use the OKIDATA ML192 printer driver, extract 
all the files from OKI.ARC and then type the command:

        LIB gradlib,-+prtcntl-+prtgc-+pframe,,gradlib

After installing the library, you have to copy GRADLIB.LIB to the directory 
\LIB or whatever the directory included in the environment variable LIB so 
that the link can find the GRADLIB.LIB at link time.


COMPILING SAMPLE PROGRAMS

     If you already have the executable files of the sample programs for your 
system configuration, you do not need to compile the source files and you may 
skip over this section.

     To compile the sample programs, you must have the Microsoft C compiler 
version 4.0 with the small model library and GRAD library (GRADLIB.LIB) 
installed.

     Seven programs with source listing and one program with object module 
only are included. Three of them (interp, mprint and swprt) requires the GRAD 
library and others are utility programs for GRAD system and GRAD library is 
not required.

To compile interp, mprint and swprt, use the following commands:
        cl /AS /J /Ox interp.c execfunc /link gradlib
        cl /AS /J /Ox mprint.c execfunc /link gradlib
        cl /AS /J /Ox swprt.c /link gradlib

To compile other programs, type:
        cl /AS /J /Ox tex2grad.c
        cl /AS /J /Ox rotate.c
        cl /AS /J /Ox size.c
        cl /AS /J /Ox time.c
        link dispfont,dispfont,nul,gradlib;


USING GRAD LIBRARY WITHOUT INSTALLATION

     If you don't have the LIB program or you don't want to use the driver in 
the library for whatever reason, you can force a certain driver to be included 
in your program instead the one in the library by including their names in 
linking. For example, if you want to compile swprt using OKIDATA ML192 driver, 
you should extract the files from OKI.arc and use the command:

        cl /AS /J /Ox swprt.c prtcntl pframe prtgc /link gradlib

Similarly if you you want to use any other drivers, place the names of the 
object files of the driver in the command line during compilation or linking.

     You only need to include the display driver only if you use the graphics 
display screen. And you will need the printer driver only if you the function 
PrintFrame.

     In the sample programs, interp, mprint and swprt requires a printer 
driver and interp, dispfont needs a display driver.
