     The GRAD User's manual is written for Microsoft C V4.0 (MSC for short) 
users. If you are using Turbo C (TC for short) by Borland, you have to read 
this file. It will describe the difference in using the GRAD library.

Chapter 1
     The speed of GRAD functions for MSC and TC is basically the same because 
most of the low level drawing function is performed by assembly routines. But 
in ellipse drawing, MSC is about 10% faster than TC.

Chapter 2.1 (p.4 near the bottom)
     The command for compiling the program onedot.c should change to

        tcc onedot.c gradlib.lib

and include -I and -L option if necessary.

Chapter 2.1 (p.5 bottom)
     The make file should change to:

        OPTIMIZE=-O -r -Z
        OPTION=-ms -a -f- -K -c $(OPTIMIZE) 

        .asm.obj:
                masm /ML $*;

        .c.obj:
                cc $(OPTION) $*.c

        onedot.obj:     onedot.c

        onedot.exe:     onedot.obj
                tlink /c /d c0s onedot,onedot,nul,gradlib cs

APPENDIX B
     If you need to change the screen memory address (_SCREEN), you have to 
change the address defined in both calcaddr.asm and ftable.c. You cannot change 
the address of the ROM character pattern by changing the value in calcaddr.asm 
when using TC. You need the source listings to do the change when using TC.
