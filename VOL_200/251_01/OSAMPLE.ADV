; SAMPLE.ADV
;
; This is a VERY simple sample adventure that uses the "BASIC.ADI" simple
; runtime support code.  It isn't interesting to play, but does illustrate
; most of the features of the adventure authoring system.  Try compiling
; it using the command:
;
;        A>ADVCOM SAMPLE
;
; When the compile has finished, run the adventure using the command:
;
;        A>ADVINT SAMPLE
;
; You should then see the initial welcome message and a description of
; your initial location.  You can use the direction names to move from
; one location to the next (or the abreviations N,S,E,W).  You should try
; manipulating objects using TAKE and DROP.  You can manipulate more than
; one at a time by using the conjunction AND.  You can also GIVE an object
; to another creature like the DOG or CAT.  You can instruct another
; creature to perform an action like:
;
;       CAT, GIVE THE DOG THE KEY
;
; You can also experiment with using adjectives to distinguish between
; objects (there is more than one KEY in this adventure).
