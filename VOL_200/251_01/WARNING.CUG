
WARNING !!

This system relies on the default behavior of Aztec's read()
and write(). Under Aztec the default behavior of low-level
i/o is to read and write binary files. To adapt to other
compilers you may need to modify all open() calls to
specifically request binary mode (i.e. insert "rb" or "wb" mode
strings).
