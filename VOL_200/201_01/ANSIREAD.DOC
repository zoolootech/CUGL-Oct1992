Subject:  Proposal of article on the complete implementation of the
          MS-DOS/PC-DOS "ANSI.SYS" device driver (cursor, screen and
          extended keyboard controls) in the C programming language.

Dear Editor, Ladies & Gentlemen:

Do you realize that most, if not all, of the big-name C compiler
packages do not provide even the most rudimentary screen, graphics
or cursor control capability?  You can't even clear the screen!

I have implemented the DOS "ANSI.SYS" device driver in the
(Microsoft/-Lattice) C programming language in a new and unique
manner that is a real boon for the C programmer.  Now C is as snazzy
to program in as BASIC or Pascal--and all it costs the programmer is
the price of your magazine!

My "ANSISYS.c" header file (260+ lines of source code and comments
included) provides the C programmer with quick and easy "smart" cursor
control and eye-catching "turtlegraphics"-type screen and graphics commands
which really turn his C programs into professional-quality productions.

In addition, I include a demonstration program--"ANSIDEMO.EXE"--to
run as a superb demonstration of these powerful and versatile C macros and
functions in action.  The source code and comments ("ANSIDEMO.c", 470+
lines) are included and stand as an excellent introduction and reference
source to the philosophy and structure of the C programming language.

The examples show how the C programmer can easily create, combine
and build-up his own professional custom library of macros and functions--up
to and including a WINDOW() command--to do what HE wants them to do, instead
of taking a chance on one of those expensive utility function libraries.

The C programming language becomes much easier to learn and more fun
to use when the cursor, screen and keyboard commands are in the familiar
BASIC or dBASE~ syntax, as I designed them to be.  In addition, these new
commands have the effect of tightening up and streamlining and modularizing
the code; you will not fail to notice that "ANSIDEMO.c" has a highly
structured and very dBASE-ish look.  (Just brilliant: maybe it's me.)

Included with this cover letter for your perusal are printouts of
the "ANSISYS.c" and "ANSIDEMO.c" files, which are on the enclosed diskette.
The article I am proposing is for you to reprint these two files--which
already contain adequate comments within--along with a short introduction
or lead-in (possibly excerpted from these pages or, as requested, from me).

The diskette is a PC-DOS 2.1 boot disk with "ANSI.SYS" and "CONFIG.SYS"
already on it--just boot up with it and run "ANSIDEMO.EXE".  (I can
supply other interested parties with this diskette for just $15.00.)

If you are interested in publishing this valuable and informative
program/article, please contact me ASAP.  (I don't know exactly what you
pay, but I do want top-dollar for it.  I hope you'll agree it's worth it.)

Thank you, Don F. Ridgway

simply say I am a C programmer/analyst living in Tampa, Florida.

However, for your own information, among my current various business
interests I am the owner and CEO of A-1 IBM~ Programming & Training
Service, and I am the chief programmer/analyst of CUSTOM BUSINESS PROGRAMS.
I am the president of the Florida Professional Programmers' Guild and
coordinator of Tampa dBASE II~ & dBASE III~ Users' Group (see DATA BASED
ADVISOR "User Groups" listing each issue).

I am also a writer and an ex-photojournalist.  For the past twenty
years my articles and/or photos have appeared in the nation's best
newspapers along with such magazines as The WRITER and Psychology Today.

My last (published) newspaper column was in The Washington Inquirer,
March 1, 1985, "The Oath They Never Took," p. 6.  My last (published)
article for a computer magazine was in the DATA BASED ADVISOR, June
1985, "Managing dBASE~ Data Files," pp. 31, 76.
