EXECUTE.C is the source code for enhanced versions of the functions exec()
and chain().  It defines two functions called _exec() and _chain() that are
in every way identical to exec() and chain(), with one minor exception.
exec() and chain() look for the program to be executed *ONLY* in the current
directory.  _exec() and _chain() look first in the current directory, then
searches through the current PATH, if one exists.  In addition, if the name
of the program to be executed is COMMAND.COM, it will first check to see if
the environment variable COMSPEC is defined, and if so, will use what it says
to use as a shell.

To use these functions, you'll need to compile the file EXECUTE.C and bind
the resulting EXECUTE.O file together with EXEC.O and your program.  If you
are using the _chain() entry point, be sure to make EXEC the first name in
your list of files that are being bound together.  This guarantees that the
maximum amount of available memory is allocated to the program being chained
to.

Enjoy!
