     This is a MSDOS generic program derived from the CP/M-86 
version by Bill Bolton found on SIG/M Volume #210. MSDOS 2.0 or
higher is required for operation. This is a disk file CRC 
checking and generating utility originally written for CP/M-80,
CP/M-86, MP/M-86 and Concurrent PC-DOS, now available for MSDOS.
CRC will run on systems with as little as 25K of RAM.

    CRC is a companion utility to CRCBUILD which creates -CATALOG 
files. This utility uses the -CATALOG file as an interactive look 
up table and displays *MATCH* on your screen next to each line 
whose embedded CRC agrees with disk contents. This CRC utility 
may be used to verify the integrity of PC-BLUE or SIG/M public 
domain distribution disks, all of which contain a standard format 
-CATALOG file.

     This utility will optionally create an output file on 
the default drive, listing the CRC's of all files checked in a
single session. That output file may be used in place of the 
-CATALOG file to perform integrity checks.


COMMANDS:

		CRC [drive:]<filename.filetype> [F]

		Examples:

	CRC			Will attempt to find CRCKLIST.???,
				  or CRCKFILE.??? or -CATALOG.???	
				  and try to match recorded CRC values
				  in that file with values calculated
				  on the fly for files on the disk. 

	CRC MYFILE.ASM		Check only MYFILE.ASM

	CRC B:*.ASM		Check all .ASM files ON B: drive

	CRC *.* F		Check all files, writing output to a file


     Hidden files as well as files with the '$$$' extention are 
ignored.

     Path names as part of the file specification are not 
supported in this version. To check the CRC of files in a 
sub-directory, first log in that sub-directory, then run CRC
from a different drive with the drive designation of the sub-
directory as part of the file specification. To run CRC from
the root directory of the A: drive and CRC all files on the 
\user\progs\asm sub-directory of the B: drive, do the following:

	A>cd B:\user\progs\asm
	A>CRC B:*.*


ALGORITHM NOTES

     The cyclic-redundancy-checksum (CRC) used in this program 
is based on the following CCITT standard polynominal:

	X^16 + X^15 + X^13 + X^7 + X^4 + X^2 + X + 1

     A CRC is a 16 bit number which is derived by forming a hash 
total of each byte contained in a file. A CRC differs from a 
simple arithmetic checksum in that bit shifting is applied giving 
the CRC byte order sensitivity. XMODEM, which implements both 
simple checksum as well as CRC protocol has been determined to 
detect 95% of transmission errors using checksums as oposed to 
99.95% with the same CCITT CRC employed here.

     Special attention in this implementation has been given 
to insure that it generates CRC's which are not only compatable 
with SIG/M -CATALOG files and XMODEM CRC's, but which are also 
communication chanel insensitive. Generated CRC's will remain 
unchanged when files are moved from MSDOS or UNIX through 
communication's chanels which pad file resolution to 128 byte 
block boundaries. It is thus useful for checking the accuracy of 
such file transfers.

     This implementation achieves much greater accuracy than a 
simple checksum with virtually no performance penalty. The CRC 
algorithm employed herein uses the XOR mask and word shifting 
techniques which prove table lookup methods slow by comparison. 
See Greg Morse's article in BYTE, Septmeber 1986, page 115 for 
the details of the mathematical theory. Sceptics may set the 
CRC_ENABLE equate FALSE to assemble a version of this utility 
which excludes the CRC generation subroutine and thus determine 
by subtraction the amount of time consumed by that algorithm. The 
CRC disabled version also makes for an interesting comparision 
with the directory searching and disk reading efficiency of "COPY 
*.* NUL". See, Dr. Dobbs Journal, "MS DOS Disk Speed" by D. E. 
Cortesi, September 1985, page 12.

SPECIAL MSDOS NOTE

	This CRC version fixes a bug in some MSDOS versions whereby
partial sectors of files were not being processed. Such versions
generate "00 00" CRC values for files less than 128 bytes in length
and incorrect values for files not an exact multiple of 128 bytes
long. Use this version of CRC with CRCBUILD version 1.1 or greater
which also fixes this bug.


CREDITS

	The 8 bit version of the program was originally conceived 
by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ, to whom all glory and honour. Due to 
the scarcity of source code in the MSDOS public domain, the MSDOS 
version of this program has been derived from the CP/M-86 version 
by Bill Bolton, Software Tools BBS, Australia. Many thanks to 
Bill Bolton and the many other CP/M-86 programmers who continue 
enable the rest of us to learn from their examples in the best
spirt of the public domain.
