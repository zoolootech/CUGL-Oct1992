The following is a description of how to use the 3-D medical image
surface reconstruction software package. This software is described
in "3-D Reconstruction in Medical Imaging" by D. Geist and M. Vannier.

This software was developed in Microscoft "C", Version 5 on a Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) Vaxmate personal computer, an IBM PC/AT clone.


1. INPUT

   The input data is assumed to be a sequence of consecutive CT scan image
   files. The name of the files is assumed to be CTBILD.nnn where nnn is a
   three digit number (with preceeding zeros if necessary). Each file has 
   a header of 512 bytes and then 256 lines of CT data. Each line contains 
   256 CT values (or 512 bytes). A CT value is an unsigned integer 
   corresponding to an Hounsfield value. 0 is -1024 in Hounsfield units.
   The input files are assumed to be in the default directory.

2. GRAD 

   This module is the reconstruction program. it creates six main axis
   views from the CT files. This module may run a couple of hours 
   depending on the hardwre installed. A floating point co-processor and
   a main memory disk device will accelerate execution time.
   
   The program starts out by askinig you several questions and then it 
   executes the reconstruction. The program does two passes over the data
   after each one six images are created, three gradient shaded and three
   distance (depth) shaded. The program creates output and temporary files.

   These files take about a Mbyte of space. The temporary file are to be
   later used with the other modules.

   The following is the questions asked by the program and thir meaning:
    
   "Enter Zoom factor: "

   The Zoom factor is the ratio of the voxel dimensions between the X and
   Z dimensions. It is a floating point number 1 =< ZOOM <= 5.

   "Enter Starting scan number: " 

    This is the number of your first CTBILD file.

   "Enter Ending scan number: " 

    This is the number of your last CTBILD file.

   "Enter Threshold value: "

    The threshold value is the value of the voxel threshold to use in
    the reconstruction. All voxels below this value will be discarded.

    The typical threshold for reconstructing bone surfaces is 175 and
    for soft tissue image -200.

    "Enter Temporary drive:

    This is the drive letter to use for your temporary disk name.
    If you have a RAM-DISK this can be useful for speeding execution.
    If you have no memory disk just enter your default drive.

    Here is an example ofa session:

    Enter Zoom factor: 3.4
    Enter starting scan number: 1
    Enter ending scan number: 80
    Enter Threshold value: 175
    Enter temporary drive: d


    After the run information is recieved the program starts executing.

    It notifies the terminal after passing each slice. The slices are
    numbered from 0 and onward. This is done twice (once for every pass).

    Example:

    starting forward pass over data
    did slice 0
    did slice 1
    .
    .
    .
    did slice 78
    starting backward pass over data
    did slice 0
    did slice 1
    .
    .
    .
    did slice 78
    number of lines = 240.

    The number of lines is the number of lines in the side views it is:
    number_of_lines = number_of _slices * Zoom_factor.
    The number of lines in the top and bottom images is always 256.

 OUTPUT

    The output is a set of 8-bit grayscale images. no special format is
    assumed and they contain no header. you must supply your own program
    to convert them to your frame buffer format.

    G(D)BO.OUT - bottom gradient (distance) shaded image
    G(D)RL.OUT - right lateral gradient (distance) shaded image
    G(D)RE.OUT - rear gradient (distance) shaded image
    G(D)TO.OUT - top gradient (distance) shaded image
    G(D)LL.OUT - left lateral gradient (distance) shaded image
    G(D)FR.OUT - front gradient (distance) shaded image
    
    REMARK: G(D)TO, G(D)LL , G(D)RE and G(D)FR need to fliped.

    In addition the files six "&dis#.dat" are created on the temporary
    drive where & stands for x,y or z and # stands for 1 and 2.

    A "param.dat" file is created on your default drive.

    All these files are needed by "ANG" and "FLIP" so you should not
    erase them before you have finished processing the case.

3. ANG

   This module creates rotated views of the image aroud the Z -axis.
   The module uses the temporary files created by GRAD. The program
   asks for an angle between 0 t0 360 and creates a rotated view in
   that angle. The output is the two files G(D)ANG.OUT.

   DO NOT ENTER MAIN AXIS ANGLES: (0,90,180,270).

4. FLIP*

   These modules flip an image file around an axis.

	flipd - around the diagonal axis
	fliph - around the horizotal axis
	flipv - around the vertical axis

   These programs accept three parameters the input file, the output
   file and the number of lines in the image (in this sequence).
   You can either enter all or part of them on the command line or be
   prompted by the program.

   There is no default input.
   The default output file is the input file with extension "flp".

   The number of lines can be specified in several ways:
   1) Directly as a number on the command line or when prompted.
   2) By specifying /D on the command line - the  number of lines 
      becomes 256. 
   3) By specifying /P on the command line - the  number of lines 
      is taken from the file "param.dat" created by GRAD. 

   Examples:
   A) FLIPH GFR.OUT GFR.NEW /P
   B) FLIPV GTO.OUT /D
   C) FLIPD
       Enter fin: GLL.OUT
       Enter fout: GLL.FLP
       Enter lines: 230

5. Future developments.

   The source programs are supplied. If you are an experienced progammer
   in C, you are welcome to examine them and modify them to your needs.
