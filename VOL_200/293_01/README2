The two disk contains the following files:

grad.c,grad.exe - the source and executable module to create 
                  images in the main axis directions.

ang.c,ang.exe -   the source and executable module to create
		  rotated images (to be executed after grad).

flip*.c,flip*.exe - the source and executable module to flip
		  an image file. * stands for d,h,v (diagonal,
		  horizontal or vertical axis).

3_D.BAT -         Batch file to execute a 3-D reconstruction
                  sequence using all of the above.

3_D.DOC -         A brief document describing everything in this
		  software package.

totarga.c,totarga.exe - the source and executable module to 
          convert a 3-D view into AT&T Targa Format

tofg1oo.c,tofg100.exe - source and executable module to display
          a view on the screen using an Imaging technology FG100
          board and the ITEX100 software library.
