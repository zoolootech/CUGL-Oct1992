Changes between beta-test release of Feb. '88 and initial release:

	- many files renamed to remove "flex" prefix
	- input() routine added to compressed and fast skeletons
	- unput() routine added to compressed skeleton
	- -d, -ce support for fast scanners
	- symbol table extended to avoid ugly casts of ints <-> char *'s;
	  this may relieve MS-DOS woes
	- actions are now separated with YY_BREAK instead of simple "break"'s
	- fixed bug causing core-dumps if skeleton file could not be opened
	- fixed bugs in logic deciding which options cannot be intermixed
	- initial start condition can now be referred to as <INITIAL>
	- fixed bug which would incorrectly computer trailing context
	  count for a pattern like "(foo){3}"; now this is considered
	  "variable length", even though it isn't.
	- block comments allowed between rules
	- misc. typos corrected

Changes with  Microsoft C v5.1 / MS-DOS port, Jan. 89 (DrH)

    - truncated filenames in accord with DOS conventions.
            fastskeldef.h   --> fastskel.h
            flex.fastskel   --> fastskel.c
            flexskelcom.h   --> skelcom.h
            flexskeldef.h   --> skeleton.h
            flex.skel       --> skeleton.c

    - extensive prototype declarations of functions so that
        several new header files exist:
            ccl.h   dfa.h   ecs.h
            main.h  misc.h  nfa.h
            sym.h

    - temporary files are now written to the current subdirectory
        instead of to \tmp.

    - The environment string FLEXENV can be used to specify the
		location of the flex skeleton files if they aren't in the
		current working directory.

	I moved FLEX to an IBM PS/2 Model 70, under OS/2 1.2 EE
	BETA code, using the IBM C/2 compiler.

	I added a USAGE message if you type FLEX only at the prompt,
	before this change the program HUNG if you did that.  

	I corrected the 'parse.y' and 'scan.l' files so they
	had the correct headers and generated the correct 'c' files.
	No ONE individual had run these through BISON and FLEX
	for a WHILE and the changes where IN the GENERATED files.
	The first time you ran ORIGINAL files through their
	respective translations the CHANGES were destroyed. What
	I did is made the changes in the ORIGINALS ran them
	through BISON and FLEX, and GOT the whole thing to compile
	clean. PLEASE see the 'flex.mak' file.
