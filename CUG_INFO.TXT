The C User's Group
------------------

The C Users' Group (CUG) facilitates the exchange of code and 
information among C programmers. Among other services, the group maintains 
this library of over 360 volumes of public domain C and C++ source code. 


-------------------------
The C Users Journal (CUJ)
-------------------------

The C Users Journal is the successor to the C Users' Group Newsletter and
The C Journal. Subscribers are automatically enrolled as members of The
C Users'Group. The C Users Journal and The C Users' Group are services
of R&D Publications, Inc., Lawrence, Ks.

What Is The C Users' Group Code Like?
-------------------------------------

Unlike machine-centered user groups, CUG has collected C source code 
from a wide variety of environments. The code has been developed on 
machines as tiny as the Radio Shack Color Computer or as large as 
a Cray II. As a consequence the quality, dialect and portability of 
the code varies greatly. Unless you intend to use a program written 
for a PC clone on a PC clone you should expect to make at least minor 
modifications to the code.

For the most part, code developed on MS-DOS will port easily to UNIX 
and vice-versa. The exception would be programs that directly manipulate 
hardware devices (such as the video display) or that use large UNIX 
packages (such as curses).

---------
Copyright
---------

The copyright status varies among the types of volume. Each volume
includes information identitying its copyright status. The possible types are:

public -- released to the public domain with no restrictions.

share1 -- shareware, source code included.

share2 -- shareware, source code not included but available from the
          author for a small registration fee.

restricted -- copyright reserved or use restricted, but no registration
              fee requested.

mixed -- copyright status varies from file to file through the volume.

-----------------
Submission Policy
-----------------

CUG is interested in ALL user supported C and C++ source  code.
Programs need not be new and unique, nor massive, to be useful  to
other members. Many times even minor modifications of existing  library
programs are important to other members, especially if the 
modifications improve the portability of the code. 

CUG accepts submissions only from the author or copyright holder. 
All submissions must be accompanied by the author's release form provided 
on most CUG volumes. 

In part the author's release is designed to protect the interests 
of members who desire to restrict for-profit distribution of their 
product. For tax purposes CUG is a service of R & D Publications, 
Inc., a for-profit Kansas corporation. We had originally intended 
to organize as a non-profit corporation but found it was an unbelievable 
hassle. We hope this release will allow authors to clearly authorize 
distribution by CUG while at the same time protecting their residual 
rights.

We make every effort to respect the intentions of the submitting author 
when distributing software.

--------------------------
Guidelines For Submissions
--------------------------

If you (or perhaps several authors) have placed restrictions 
on your material, include ALL the restrictions prominently on the 
outside of the disk.

Write the disk format on the outside of the disk!!!

If you submit text files (documentation):

DO NOT send them in some word-processor format.

Please DO send all text files on a disk. We can read almost all MS-DOS 
and UNIX tar/cpio formats.

Include a one or two paragraph summary of the disk contents on the 
disk, along with a longer (two to ten pages) article which is detailed 
enough that it will help members decide whether the submission is 
of use to them.

Finally, unless you are really serious about policing the users of 
your software, reconsider restricting it. We will certainly respect 
your wishes, but you should be warned that you will be very hard-pressed 
to enforce copyright privileges once a product has been distributed 
free to any class of users. Our fear is that most of the restrictions 
we are so carefully repeating are legally unenforceable and thus are 
accomplishing little except to consume group time.
