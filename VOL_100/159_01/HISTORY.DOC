(1)	Ported code to compile under the Eco-C88 compiler for the IBM/PC.
(2)	Added conditional code to allow the adventure to be compiled under
	the Lattice and DeSmet compilers (refer to the conditional switches
	in ADVENT.H for compiler selection).
(3)	Re-formatted all of the text databases to take better advantage of
	an 80 column screen.
(4)	Added type casts at various places to keep the Lattice compiler from
	complaining.
(5)	Performed fairly extensive modification to the file I/O portion of
	the program to allow it to use MS-DOS stream I/O.
(6)	Added functions for initb() and initw() which do not exist under any
	of the target compilers.
(7)	Doubled the number of file offset indexes kept for databases ADVENT1,
	ADVENT2, ADVENT3, and ADVENT6.	This did not significantly increase
	the size of the executable module but does speed access to the text
	stored in these files.
(8)	Modified sub-modules EADVENT.C and SAVEADV.C so that the entire
	program could be linked together to produce a single executable file
	rather than performing dynamic loads of these two modules (via exec).

     These modifications were compiled and tested under the following IBM/PC
     compilers:

	     Eco-C88 Version 2.72	     Ecosoft, Inc.
	     Lattice C Version 2.14	     Lattice, Inc.
	     DeSmet C Version 2.41	     C-Ware, Inc.

     The resultant executable modules were play tested on both an IBM/PC and
     a Texas Instruments TIPC.	All versions of the game appeared to operate
     properly, however, the game was not played to it's conclusion.

** Note that when running this program under MS-DOS a CONFIG.SYS file is
   required to set the FILES= parameter to at least 10 files.  Failure to do
   this will result in an error message that the program was not able to open
   file ADVENT6.DAT.

 (1)  Ported code to Microsoft C V 5.10 and 6.00
 (2)  Placed all global variables in header ADVENT.H
 (3)  Removed most runtime variable initialization and replaced
      by compile time initializers.
 (4)  Added file ADVENTDB.C to completely replace all the adventure
      data base files.	This keeps all data in memory and eliminates
      all disk accesses during game play.  All functions in DATABASE.C
      were modified to access in memory data.
 (5)  Added code to support the BRIEF and VERBOSE verbs.
 (6)  Added code to ignore CTRL-C signal.
 (7)  Modified vocab search to use a binary search.
