The correct order in which to read the documentation files is: 
QE122.DOC, QED11.DOC, QED.DOC, E.DOC.  The latter is not supplied
on QED disks, but the QEDx.DOC files should be sufficient to use the 
editor.  E.DOC is available from CUG. QEDFUNCS.DOC is a list of 
functions by file and is valuable for modifying the editor.  
QEDPC.DOC is a short introduction to QED and most of the features are 
understandable without reading any of the above documentation files.

The QE*.O files have been compiled for the IBMPC version.

Please feel free to report any bugs or suggestions for future 
modifications to me at the address below.  More importantly, make 
your own modifications and report them, if significant, to CUG.
