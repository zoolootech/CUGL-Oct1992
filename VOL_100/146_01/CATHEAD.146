HEADER:      CUG146.01;
TITLE:       Small C compiler for 6800;
VERSION:     Ver. 2 for FLEX;
DATE:        08/13/1982;
DESCRIPTION: "A version of Ron Cain's Small-C adapted for the
             6800 micro under TSC's FLEX operating system. Initial conversion
             was done on a PDP 11 running RSX-11 and the DECUS (public domain)
             C compiler with Small C code from DECUS. Ongoing development of
             this version is being carried out on a SWTPC 6800 with dual
             8 inch floppies and 32K RAM.";
KEYWORDS:    Small C; 6800, FLEX, Ron Cain, Serge Stepanoff, compiler;
SYSTEM:      See DESCRIPTION;
FILENAME:    CATHEAT.146;
WARNINGS:    "The TSC assembler accepts any length labels but only
             the first 6 characters are used and saved in the symboltable.
             Therefore, if you have either funcitons or labels of the type
             MODULE1 and MODULE2, the assembler will generate a multiply
             defined lable error. Make sure that the first 6 characters
             are unique.";
