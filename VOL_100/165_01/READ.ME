This diskette contains the programs from Reliable Data Structures in C,
by Thomas Plum.  The programs are copyright (c) Plum Hall Inc, 1985.
Permission is hereby granted for you to reproduce these programs in
any machine-readable medium, to use them and incorporate them in
other machine-readable forms (such as linkage libraries and compiled
programs), and to distribute any printed human-readable copies.

Some of the source files are catenated together into larger files,
because many of our target environments do not have subdirectory
structure.  There is a program  UNIRD  ("universal read distribution")
provided in source UNIRD.C and MS-DOS executable UNIRD.EXE.  It splits
the large files into their named constituents.

Thus, to reconstitute the individual files, use commands something
like this:

	UNIRD <HEADERS.D
	UNIRD <SOURCE.D
	UNIRD <CONFIG.D
	UNIRD <TESTS.D


The file CONFIG.D has several environment-specific files, including a
MAKEFILE.  Each of these files will require hand-tailoring for your
specific environment.  I have attempted to indicate many of the specific
tailorings required by marking the affected lines with "@@".

The file TESTS.D contains sample test-inputs and expected test results.
See the MAKEFILE for details of how to use these tests.

There are many files in this distribution -- over 100.
If your system has a limit on the number of files in one
directory, you may need to extract each piece separately and combine
components one-by-one.

Please feel free to call us if there are questions or problems.

We have decided to make these programs widely available via networks,
users groups, and computer clubs. If you would like to help with such
distribution, please give us a call.  We would especially appreciate
assistance with putting them on the USENET.
