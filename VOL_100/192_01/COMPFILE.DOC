COMPFILE:
  This program compares two files.  It informs the user about which
  of these conditions is true:

      a) The files are identical.

      b) The files are identical up to the point where one file 
         is merely longer than the other.

      c) The files differ.  The first bytes that are different
         are displayed as well as the byte's sequential number
         and line number (which only has meaning for ASCII files.)

  To invoke the program, merely type:

     COMPFILE

  in response to the DOS prompt with the program in the default drive.
  The program will then prompt the user to enter the names of the
  two files.
