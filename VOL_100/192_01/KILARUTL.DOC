KILARUTL:

  The Kilar Utilities for 360K diskettes containing no subdirectories.
  This program supplies a number of enhancements to DOS and even
  the Norton Utilities for operations with diskettes.

  To invoke the program, type:

     KILARUTL

  in response to the DOS prompt with the program in the default drive.


  The program will prompt the user to specify which drive the diskette
  to be analyzed is in.  At that point the program reads the File Allocation
  Tables and Directory areas of the diskette.  The program calculates how
  fragmented the file structure of the diskette is.  If it is excessively
  fragmented, which can greatly reduce file access times, this note is
  displayed on the screen.

  A menu than appears for various operations the user can specify.  The
  user can select one of the following:

    1) Display/modify a sector on the diskette - The user specifies which
       sector he wants to display (dump) or modify.  The hex contents are
       displayed on the screen.  He can than either return to the main
       menu or modify some of the sector's data.

             ** WARNING - A NOVICE OR EVEN CARELESS EXPERT CAN DESTROY
                  DATA BY MISUSING MODIFY.  BE CAREFUL! **

    2) Display all sectors used by a file - The user enters the name
       of the file desired.  The program will display the number of
       each sector allocated to the file.

    3) Display a cluster map.  The program displays a map showing the
       current use of each cluster (set of two sectors).  The file
       it currently belongs to or the fact that the cluster is free
       (not allocated) is displayed for each data cluster on the disk.

    4) Save a sector as a file.  The program prompts the user to enter
       a sector number.  If the cluster containing the sector is free,
       it is saved as file SECTOR.FIL.  If currently in use by a file,
       the program will state so and not save the cluster as a file.

    5) Display the use of a specified sector.  The program prompts the
       user to enter a sector number.  The program will inform the
       user whether the sector is currently allocated to a file.  If
       it is, it will display the name of the file.

    6) Return to DOS.

  Each operation (except the latter) returns to the main menu after
  completed.
