MKVOLUME:

  This program allows the user to give a 360K diskette a volume name
  if it does not already have one.  Under MS/PC-DOS, normally a
  user can only specify a volume name when formatting the diskette.
  This program provides the capability to specify a volume name without
  altering the files already on the diskette.

  To invoke the program, type:

     MKVOLUME

  in response to the DOS prompt with the program in the default drive.
  The program will prompt the user for the drive and volume name
  specifications.
