CUG WARNING:

	The files on this disk were transferred from the CP/M-80 
system.  The .COM files will not execute properly on the IBM PC since 
they are intended for microprocessors running CP/M-80 and not for 
the IBM and PC-DOS.  Attempting to run .COM files intended for 
CP/M-80 could cause undesirable results including a crash of your 
machine and loss of valuable data.  

	Therefore, you must recompile the source code under your own 
C compiler before running the programs.  Be alert, also, to operating 
system and hardware differences.

	Any files which were compressed in the original CP/M-80 
format have been expanded back to ASCII form for the PC-DOS format.  
Any references in the documentation to procedures for unsqueezing 
or decompression should be ignored.

	Please note that any file names which originally contained 
the characters '+' or '/' have had these characters replaced by a '-'.  
This is necessary to meet PC-DOS file name restrictions.  The 
documentation and source files have not been modified to reflect 
these changes; please make allowances for this fact.
