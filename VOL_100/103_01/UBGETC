ubgetc  is just like getc only it was compiled so that it only buffers
up  one sector (didnt want to take up too much stack space) it is used
in  only one place in the editor and that is where the <edit.hlp> file
is  printed  out  by  the  help commmand. other than that there are no
accesses to ubgetc (easy to change).
