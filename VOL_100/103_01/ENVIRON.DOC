all programs on this disk were written under version 1.4 thru
1.43a of BDS C.
all programs were written under CP/M v1.4 on MICROMATION Z-64
and DOUBLER floppy disk controller with SUPER SERIAL serial I/O
card.  (8251a type RS232).
the ONLY modification to the stdlib is in ONLY one function
ONLY in the editor ONLY to print out the EDIT.HLP file of help
the function is called UBGETC (for unbuffered (slight misnomer)
getc) which is different from the std version only in that the
number of sectors buffered up is ONE.  (we just temporarily 
changed BDSCIO.H for one sector and recompiled and then clibed over
the version and renamed it along the way)  (this was done to conserve
stack space).
we use TI-810 printer for hardcopy (nice machine but expensive though)
and usually televideo terminals or soroc or intertube.
DIO was modified for use with roff so that output could also be
directed to more than one place at a time. the altered version is
included.
THERE should be virtually no system dependencies to the best of my
knowledge.
if you find this to not be the case please feel free to let me know.

a new version of roff is on its way and should be ready in a month or
so.
