	The attached three programs were developed in the course
of using BDS-C to write a graphics package for the SCION Microangelo
(registered trademark) graphics sub-system.  Their application was
required when converting graphic data from an input file in floating
format to integer graphics commands.  I would be interested in
any further extensions to the floating point capabilities.  I tried
adding some traps to the floating point package to take care of
underflow and overflow.  They messed up the conversion ASCII to
floating point, though.  I plan to add log and exponent functions
later, but if someone would use the logic in CTRIG and beat me
to the punch -- great!  Thanks.
