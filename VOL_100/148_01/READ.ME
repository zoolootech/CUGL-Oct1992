	Notes on A99 -- A Cross Assembler for the TMS9900 & TMS99105 CPU's
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	The files that make up the cross assembler follow closely
	the original files which were part of A68.  A68 was written
	by William Colley III - and in A68 he produced a fine display of
	of modular programming.  For this reason this version of A99
	follows very closely his original work.  The main changes lie
	in the files  a99tbls.csm ,a99eval and a99asmln.c.  a99symb.c had
	what I believe was a bug - in hash() a declaration of an int value
	instead of an unsigned value resulted in a wrap around of the symbol
	table - this was a subtle one and took a while to find.

	Most of the attributes of the assembler are reasonably well 
	documented in XASM99.DOC, however it is worth noting that
	the assembler will not generate code for the 99110 series of CPU's.
	As I am only interested in the TMS9900 and the TMS99105A CPU
	I have naturally only implemented the instructions of these
	two.  The TMS99110A additional instructions may be easily 
	implemented if so desired by adding to the table in a99tbls.csm
	re-assembling and linking the whole package.
