

This program was designed to be used with my standard
8" CP/M 2.2 system, and may require modification for
use with other system. 

To get explanation of arguments, start program without
any arguments. The program reads a CPMxx.COM file from
disk, moulds it with your BIOS and then writes the result
back to the CPMxx.COM file. Optionally you may use the
-i option to sysgen immediate (8" SS disks only).
the -a option makes a patch to make user 0 files public
access, (from June -80 Lifelines), it will patch in a jump
to the address immediately after the jump to SECTRAN in
the BIOS jump table.
MAKESYS needs patching of your cold boot address if you're
going to use the '-c' argument (type MAKESYS without args
to see which are available). 
To use -c option you must change the address pointing
to the place to jump.
