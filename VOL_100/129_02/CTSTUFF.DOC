Citadel 2.4 (as of 85Jan12)

To whomever it may concern:
  We'd like to thank Jeff Vosburg (Vosburg the Wise) and Ray Schneider (The
White Knight) for obtaining Citadel from CUG; Citadel has become one of the
most popular BBSs in the Twin Cities, with now 3 regular Citadels up, 1
MS-DOS version of Citadel up as a test system, a QNX version in the
planning stages as a multi-user system, and some preliminary thoughts on
bringing Citadel up on a PDP-11.

Enhancements:
-------------
* <S>kip room command: allows user to tell Citadel to ignore the fact that he's
  gone to the room he's currently in, to preserve New Messages status.	Allows
  him to return later to that room using just <G>oto and read New Messages
  again.
* <Z>Forget room command: allows user to "delete" a room from his known rooms
  list and the <G>oto - <N>ew messages retrieval cycle.  Lessens user time and
  aggravation.	Naturally, Lobby and Mail cannot be forgotten.	Currently aides
  cannot forget anything.  See note somewhere on list regarding enhancements
  to Aide(Burden)Ship.	Consideration is being given to the wisdom of changing
  this eccentricity to either giving aides the ability or maybe making such
  a configuration switch.
      This command can be counteracted by doing a <.G>oto FORGOTTEN ROOM NAME
  and then leaving the room using any other method than <Z>Forget Room.
* <.Z>List forgotten rooms: Lists all *PUBLIC* rooms that the user has
  forgotten and that still exist (naturally).
* Aide enhancement: Aides now have access to all rooms and msgs except for other
  folks' mail.	We found desperate need, so implemented it.
* Aide enhancement: ".Aide Set Current Date" allows aides to set the date from
  remote.  Just follow the prompts.
* If one is replying to somebody in mail, recipient is automagically set for
  the replier.
* We now have an 8085 version for a Z100.  Can't seem to get Citadel to read
  CP/M-85 directory, though. For one Z100. Am now beginning to suspect a h/w
  problem (dammit).
* The name of the creator of a room is now listed in the Aide> room.
* When an aide edits a room, and s/he makes the room PRIVATE, s/he now may
  decide whether the normal users of the system should suddenly get amnesia
  concerning that room, or should remember that private room.
* When the .Aide Delete Empty Rooms command is used, the empty rooms that
  are lost are now listed in the Aide> room along with the aide that used the
  command.

Bug Fixes:
----------
* Private Rooms are now really, really, private!
* An infinite loop bug which caused the Enter Message Entry cmd: menu to cycle
  forever, ignoring user input, seems to have been solved.  We were never able
  to reproduce it, but it hasn't happened since we found a possible loophole and
  plugged it.
* Using ".Enter Configuration" now remains permanently even as you change rooms.
* Overflowing the string that contained the name of a help file via <.H>elp
  caused system crash. Fixed.
* A sysop bug: when logged in at console, deleting an account caused the name
  of the person deleted to become the sysop's name -- temporarily only. Fixed.
* Many minor trivialities.

Utilities:
----------
NOTE: These are separate programs, that do not run concurrently with Citadel.
Their usage is detailed in UTIL.DOC, the following is just short synopsis
of their purpose in life.
* Clog: Allows Sysop to look at the user log, with optional switches to send
  output to disk and to show passwords.
* Expand: Expands msg files from current size upwards.
* CtdlChng: Allows changing certain configuration switches without a complete
  fricking reconfigure.
* Clray: Allows Sysop to see rough order of people who've used system, most
  recent onwards.
* Recover1: If a room is accidently zapped, it can be recovered provided that
  no rooms have been created since.  If there have been, it may still be
  recoverable, but that's doubtful.
* Recover2: Allows recovery of trashed room file by scanning MSG.SYS.  This
  program messes up both privacy and Forgotten rooms list, should be rewritten,
  and should be used only in desperation.

Unfixed Bugs:
-------------
* Can't read CP/M-85 directory on Z100.  May be the O.S. itself. Or may be
  hardware.
* Rooms occassionally reproduce themselves, leaving the Citadel with 2 rooms
  with the same name and contents. No clues as of yet. Probably our fault.
* People tend to disappear off logs that are not anywhere near full.
o disk and to show passwords.
* Expand: Expands msg files from current size upwards.
