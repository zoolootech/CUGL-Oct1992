       TAIL ---


       The  TAIL  utility displays the last n lines of specified  files.
       The syntax is:

       TAIL -<count> <files or directories>

       As  above,  <files or directories> specifies a list of  (possibly
       wild-carded)  files and directories full	of files to be	operated
       upon.   The  <count> option,  if	not specified,	defaults to  10.
       Otherwise  you  can specify how many of the last	lines  for  each
       file  to	be displayed.	The maximum value for <count>  is  about
       450.   If  a line exceeds 130 characters,  TAIL will truncate it.
       If  no  <files or directories> is specified,  TAIL will	get  its
       input from the keyboard (or redirected input).

       Examples:

       TAIL -3 *.lst
	    will  list	the  last  3 lines of  ever  file  with	 a  .LST
       extension in the	current	directory.

       TAIL <input
	    is equivalent to
       TAIL input
	    and	will list the last 10 lines of the file	INPUT.

       TAIL -50	/temp
	    will  print	 the  last 50 lines of every file in  the  /temp
       directory.
