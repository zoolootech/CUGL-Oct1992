       FGREP ---


       The  FGREP utility searches files for particular	 text  patterns.
       Each  line on which the pattern is found	is displayed.	The text
       patterns	cannot contain blanks or any wild-cards.  The syntax is:


       FGREP <options> <pattern> <files	or directories>


       The values for <options>	are as follows:

       -r	 recursively   search  sub-directories	of   directories
		 specified  in	the list <files	 or  directories>.   The
		 default  is  to  search  only files in	 the  <files  or
		 directories>  list  and files in  directories	in  that
		 list.

       -i	 ignore	upper/lower case when matching the <pattern>.

       -l	 also print line numbers for matching text in files.

       -n	 only print file names of files	with matching text.

       -v	 reverse  the test--print all lines except those with  a
		 matching text pattern.

       -c	 only  print a count of	how many lines contain	matching
		 text.

       -^	 Treat the character ^ in the pattern string as	a blank.
		 Normally,  the	 pattern cannot	contain	a blank	 because
		 command line arguments	are separated by blanks.  The -^
		 option	 is provided so	that a blank can effectively  be
		 specified in the pattern.  For	example,

		 fgrep	-^  a^string *.pas

		 searches  all	files ending in	.pas for the  string  "a
		 string".   Without the	-^ option, the string "a^string"
		 would be searched for.

       The <pattern> parameter is the text string to search  for.   This
       string  is  specified  exactly as you want it to	 appear	 in  the
       files'  lines  (that is,	 it is not surrounded by  quotes).   The
       pattern may contain no blanks, and cannot start with a '-' (which

       is used to specify options).

       The  <files or directories> parameter is	identical to  SEARCH,  see
       above.	If no files are	given, then FGREP accepts keyboard input
       (or redirected input) to	search.

       Examples:

       FGREP -i	proc c:/sources	d:/project/*.asm
	    will  (ignoring upper/lower	case) print a list of files  and
       their  lines  which  contain the	 string	 'proc',  files	 in  the
       directory  c:/sources,  and  files with an .ASM extension in  the
       d:/project directory will be searched.

       FGREP -ri proc c:/sources d:/project/*.asm
	    will  act  as  the	above  example,	 except	 that  any  sub-
       directories  of c:/sources (and their sub-directories) will  also
       participate in the string search.
