       MV ---


       The MV command is used to move file(s).	The syntax for MV is:

       MV <file1> <file2 or directory>

       If  the	second parameter is <file2>,  then MV moves  file1  into
       file2  and  deletes  file1 (if file1 and	file2 are  on  the  same
       drive,  then file1 is renamed as	file2).	 If the	second parameter
       is a directory,	then file1 is moved into that directory, and the
       original	file1 is deleted.   The	first parameter	may be an MS-DOS
       wild-card specification.	 In this case, all files matched will be
       moved (copied and deleted) into the directory specified.

       MV  will	 never move a file onto	itself--an  error  message  will
       occur and the file will not be deleted.	 Also, do not MV a wild-
       carded  file1 onto a file2.   In	this case,  only the first  file
       will be moved and an error message will occur.

       Examples:

       MV a:/pmate.exe b:/bin
	    moves the pmate program to the binary directory of b:

       MV *.exe	b:/bin
	    moves all .EXE files to the	binary directory of b:

       MV memo.mem sept28.mem
	    renames the	file memo.mem as sept28.mem
