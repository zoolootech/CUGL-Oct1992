        1.0  How to Use the Cross-Assembler Package

             First, the question, "What does a cross-assembler do?" needs 
        to be addressed as there is considerable confusion on this point.  
        A cross-assembler is just like any other assembler except that it 
        runs on some CPU other than the one for which it assembles code.  
        For example, this package assembles 6805 source code into 6805 
        object code, but it runs on an 8080, a Z-80, an 8088, or whatever 
        other CPU you happen to have a C compiler for.  The reason that 
        cross-assemblers are useful is that you probably already have a 
        CPU with memory, disk drives, a text editor, an operating system, 
        and all sorts of hard-to-build or expensive facilities on hand.  
        A cross-assembler allows you to use these facilites to develop 
        code for a 6805.

        This program requires one input file (your 6805 source code) and 
        zero to two output files (the listing and the object).  The input 
        file MUST be specified, or the assembler will bomb on a fatal 
        error.  The listing and object files are optional.  If no listing 
        file is specified, no listing is generated, and if no object file 
        is specified, no object is generated.  If the object file is 
        specified, the object is written to this file in "Intel 
        hexadecimal" format.

             The command line for the cross-assembler looks like this:

                  A685 source_file { -l list_file } { -o object_file }

        where the { } indicates that the specified item is optional.

             Some examples are in order:

             a685 test685.asm                   source:   test685.asm
                                                listing:  none
                                                object:   none

             a685 test685.asm -l test685.prn    source:   test685.asm
                                                listing:  test685.prn
                                                object:   none

             a685 test685.asm -o test685.hex    source:   test685.asm
                                                listing:  none
                                                object:   test685.hex

             a685 test685.asm -l test685.prn -o test685.hex
                                                source:   test685.asm
                                                listing:  test685.prn
                                                object:   test685.hex

             The order in which the source, listing, and object files are 
        specified does not matter.  Note that no default file name exten-
        sions are supplied by the assembler as this gives rise to porta-
        bility problems.

        2.0  Format of Cross-Assembler Source Lines

             The source file that the cross-assembler processes into a 
        listing and an object is an ASCII text file that you can prepare 
        with whatever editor you have at hand.  The most-significant 
        (parity) bit of each character is cleared as the character is 
        read from disk by the cross-assembler, so editors that set this 
        bit (such as WordStar's document mode) should not bother this 
        program.  All printing characters, the ASCII TAB character ($09), 
        and newline character(s) are processed by the assembler.  All 
        other characters are passed through to the listing file, but are 
        otherwise ignored.

             The source file is divided into lines by newline char-
        acter(s).  The internal buffers of the cross-assembler will 
        accommodate lines of up to 255 characters which should be more 
        than ample for almost any job.  If you must use longer lines, 
        change the constant MAXLINE in file A685.H and recompile the 
        cross-assembler.  Otherwise, you will overflow the buffers, and 
        the program will mysteriously crash.

             Each source line is made up of three fields:  the label 
        field, the opcode field, and the argument field.  The label field 
        is optional, but if it is present, it must begin in column 1.  
        The opcode field is optional, but if it is present, it must not 
        begin in column 1.  If both a label and an opcode are present, 
        one or more spaces and/or TAB characters must separate the two.  
        If the opcode requires arguments, they are placed in the argument 
        field which is separated from the opcode field by one or more 
        spaces and/or TAB characters.  Finally, an optional comment can 
        be added to the end of the line.  This comment must begin with a 
        semicolon which signals the assembler to pass the rest of the 
        line to the listing and otherwise ignore it.  Thus, the source 
        line looks like this:

             {label}{ opcode{ arguments}}{;commentary}

        where the { } indicates that the specified item is optional.

             Some examples are in order:

          column 1
             |
             v
             GRONK   LDA   OFFSET, X       ; This line has everything.
                     STA   MAILBOX         ; This line has no label.
             BEEP                          ; This line has no opcode.
             ; This line has no label and no opcode.

             ; The previous line has nothing at all.
                     END                   ; This line has no argument.

        2.1  Labels

             A label is any sequence of alphabetic or numeric characters 
        starting with an alphabetic.  The legal alphabetics are:

                    ! & , . : ? [ \ ] ^ _  ` { | }  ~  A-Z  a-z

        The numeric characters are the digits 0-9.  Note that "A" is not 
        the same as "a" in a label.  This can explain mysterious U 
        (undefined label) errors occurring when a label appears to be 
        defined.

             A label is permitted on any line except a line where the 
        opcode is IF, ELSE, or ENDIF.  The label is assigned the value of 
        the assembly program counter before any of the rest of the line 
        is processed except when the opcode is EQU, ORG, or SET.

             Labels can have the same name as opcodes, but they cannot
        have the same name as operators or registers.  The reserved 
        (operator and register) names are:

             AND       EQ        GE        GT        HIGH      LE
             LT        LOW       MOD       NE        NOT       OR
             SHL       SHR       X         XOR

             If a label is used in an expression before it is assigned a 
        value, the label is said to be "forward-referenced."  For 
        example:

             L1   EQU  L2 + 1   ; L2 is forward-referenced here.
             L2
             L3   EQU  L2 + 1   ; L2 is not forward-referenced here.


        2.2  Numeric Constants

             Numeric constants can be formed in two ways:  the Intel 
        convention or the Motorola convention.  The cross-assembler 
        supports both.

             An Intel-type numeric constant starts with a numeric 
        character (0-9), continues with zero or more digits (0-9, A-F), 
        and ends with an optional base designator.  The base designators 
        are H for hexadecimal, none or D for decimal, O or Q for octal, 
        and B for binary.  The hex digits a-f are converted to upper case 
        by the assembler.  Note that an Intel-type numeric constant 
        cannot begin with A-F as it would be indistinguishable from a 
        label.  Thus, all of the following evaluate to 255 (decimal):

                   0ffH   255   255D   377O   377Q   11111111B

             A Motorola-type numeric constant starts with a base 
        designator and continues with a string of one or more digits.  
        The base designators are $ for hexadecimal, none for decimal, @ 
        for octal, and % for binary.  As with Intel-type numeric 


                                        5



        constants, a-f are converted to upper case by the assembler.  
        Thus, all of the following evaluate to 255 (decimal):

                          $ff   255   @377   %11111111

             If a numeric constant has a value that is too large to fit 
        into a 16-bit word, it will be truncated on the left to make it 
        fit.  Thus, for example, $123456 is truncated to $3456.


        2.3  String Constants

             A string constant is zero or more characters enclosed in 
        either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").  Single quotes 
        only match single quotes, and double quotes only match double 
        quotes, so if you want to put a single quote in a string, you can 
        do it like this:  "'".  In all contexts except the FCC statement, 
        the first character or two of the string constant are all that 
        are used.  The rest is ignored.  Noting that the ASCII codes for 
        "A" and "B" are $41 and $42, respectively, will explain the 
        following examples:

                  "" and ''           evaluate to $0000
                  "A" and 'A'         evaluate to $0041
                  "AB"                evaluates to $4142

        Note that the null string "" is legal and evaluates to $0000.


        2.4  Expressions

             An expression is made up of labels, numeric constants, and 
        string constants glued together with arithmetic operators, 
        logical operators, and parentheses in the usual way that 
        algebraic expressions are made.  Operators have the following 
        fairly natural order of precedence:

             Highest        anything in parentheses
                            unary +, unary -
                            *, /, MOD, SHL, SHR
                            binary +, binary -
                            LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT, NE
                            NOT
                            AND
                            OR, XOR
             Lowest         HIGH, LOW

             A few notes about the various operators are in order:

             1)   The remainder operator MOD yields the remainder from 
                  dividing its left operand by its right operand.

             2)   The shifting operators SHL and SHR shift their left 
                  operand to the left or right the number of bits 
                  specified by their right operand.


                                        6




             3)   The relational operators LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT, and NE can 
                  also be written as <, <= or =<, =, >= or =>, and <> or 
                  ><, respectively.  They evaluate to $FFFF if the 
                  statement is true, 0 otherwise.

             4)   The logical opeators NOT, AND, OR, and XOR do bitwise 
                  operations on their operand(s).

             5)   HIGH and LOW extract the high or low byte, of an 
                  expression.

             6)   The special symbol * can be used in place of a label or 
                  constant to represent the value of the program counter 
                  before any of the current line has been processed.

             Some examples are in order at this point:

             2 + 3 * 4                          evaluates to 14
             (2 + 3) * 4                        evaluates to 20
             NOT %11110000 XOR %00001010        evaluates to %00000101
             HIGH $1234 SHL 1                   evaluates to $0024
             @001 EQ 0                          evaluates to 0
             @001 = 2 SHR 1                     evaluates to $FFFF

             All arithmetic is unsigned with overflow from the 16-bit 
        word ignored.  Thus:

             32768 * 2                          evaluates to 0


        3.0  Machine Opcodes

             The opcodes of the 6805 processor are divided into groups 
        below by the type of arguments required in the argument field of 
        the source line.  Opcodes that are peculiar to certain processors 
        in the family are noted in their sections.  A few notes on the 
        source line syntax are in order at this point:

             1)   Multiple arguments must be separated from one another 
                  by commas.

             2)   In the indexed addressing mode, the expression giving 
                  the offset may be omitted.  The default offset is 0.


        3.1  Opcodes -- Control Instructions

             The following opcodes allow no arguments at all in their 
        argument fields:

             CLC       CLI       MUL *     NOP       SEC       SEI
             RSP       RTI       RTS       STOP **   SWI       TXA
             TAX       WAIT **



                                        7



                  *    Use only with the MC68HC05 processors.
                  **   Use only with CMOS processors.


        3.2  Opcodes -- Branch Instructions

             The opcodes in this group require one argument that is an 
        expression whose value is in the range *-126 thru *+129.  The 
        opcodes are:

             BCC       BCS       BEQ       BHCC      BHCS      BHI
             BIH       BIL       BLS       BMC       BMI       BMS
             BNE       BPL       BRA       BRN       BSR


        3.3  Opcodes -- Bit Manipulation Instructions

             The opcodes in this group require two or three arguments in 
        the following order:

             1)   expression     where expression is 0-7, and

             2)   expression     where expression is 0-255, and

             3)   expression     where expression is *-125 thru *+130 
                                 (BRCLR and BRSET only).

        The opcodes are:

             BRCLR     BRSET     BCLR      BSET


        3.4  Opcodes -- Read-Modify-Write Instructions

             The opcodes in this group require one argument from the 
        following list:

             1)   "A" or "X" appended to the opcode (e.g. INCA, ADDX), or

             2)   expression     where expression is 0-255, or

             3)   expression, X  where expression is 0-255.

        The opcodes are:

             ASR       CLR       COM       DEC       INC       NEG
             LSL       LSR       ROL       ROR       TST


        3.5  Opcodes -- Register/Memory Instructions

             The opcodes in this group require one argument from the 
        following list:

             1)   #expression    where expression is -128 thru 255, or


                                        8




             2)   expression     where expression is arbitrary, or

             3)   expression, X  where expression is arbitrary.

        The opcodes are:

             ADC       ADD       AND       BIT       CMP       CPX
             EOR       JMP *     JSR *     LDA       LDX       ORA
             STA *     STX *     SBC       SUB

                  *    Immediate addressing (#expression) not allowed.


        3.6  Opcodes -- Synonyms

             In keeping with Motorola's usage, certain opcode synonyms 
        are honored by the cross-assembler.  They are:

                     Synonym              Opcode

                       BHS                 BCC
                       BLO                 BCS
                       DEX                 DECX
                       INX                 INCX
                       ASL                 LSL


        3.7  Opcodes -- Direct Addressing

             The register/memory instructions of the 6805 CPU allow both 
        one-byte direct (or zero-page) addressing and two-byte extended 
        addressing.  There is no way to explicitly call for one form of 
        addressing over the other.  The assembler will choose direct 
        addressing if BOTH of the following conditions are met:

             1)   the required expression contains no forward references, 
                  and

             2)   the expression evaluates to 0-255.

        Otherwise, the assembler will choose extended addressing.  Note 
        that this makes it desireable to declare your zero-page RAM 
        locations at the top of the program so that these locations will 
        not generate forward references and foil the assembler's attempts 
        to use direct addressing and shrink the object program.


        4.0  Pseudo Opcodes

             Unlike 6805 opcodes, pseudo opcodes (pseudo ops) do not 
        represent machine instructions.  They are, rather, directives to 
        the assembler.  These directives require various numbers and 
        types of arguments.  They will be listed individually below.



                                        9




        4.1  Pseudo-ops -- END

             The END pseudo-op tells the assembler that the source 
        program is over.  Any further lines of the source file are 
        ignored and not passed on to the listing.  If an argument is 
        added to the END statement, the value of the argument will be 
        placed in the execution address slot in the Intel hex object 
        file.  The execution address defaults to the program counter 
        value at the point where the END was encountered.  Thus, to 
        specify that the program starts at label START, the END statement 
        would be:

                       END       START

             If end-of-file is encountered on the source file before an 
        END statement is reached, the assembler will add an END statement 
        to the listing and flag it with a * (missing statement) error.


        4.2  Pseudo-ops -- EQU

             The EQU pseudo-op is used to assign a specific value to a 
        label, thus the label on this line is REQUIRED.  Once the value 
        is assigned, it cannot be reassigned by writing the label in 
        column 1, by another EQU statement, or by a SET statement.  Thus, 
        for example, the following statement assigns the value 2 to the 
        label TWO:

             TWO       EQU       1 + 1

             The expression in the argument field must contain no forward 
        references.


        4.3  Pseudo-ops -- FCB

             The FCB (Form Constant Bytes) pseudo-op allows arbitrary 
        bytes to be spliced into the object code.  Its argument is a 
        chain of zero or more expressions that evaluate to -128 thru 255 
        separated by commas.  If a comma occurs with no preceding 
        expression, a $00 byte is spliced into the object code.  The 
        sequence of bytes $FE $FF, $00, $01, $02 could be spliced into 
        the code with the following statement:

                       FCB       -2, -1, , 1, 2


        4.4  Pseudo-ops -- FCC

             The FCC (Form Constant Characters) pseudo-op allows 
        character strings to be spliced into the object code.  Its 
        argument is a chain of zero or more string constants separated by 
        blanks, tabs, or commas.  If a comma occurs with no preceding 
        string constant, an S (syntax) error results.  The string 


                                       10



        contants are not truncated to two bytes, but are instead copied 
        verbatim into the object code.  Null strings result in no bytes 
        of code.  The message "Kaboom!!" could be spliced into the code 
        with the following statement:

                       FCC       "Kaboom!!"     ;This is 8 bytes of code.


        4.5  Pseudo-ops -- FDB

             The FDB (Form Double Bytes) pseudo-op allows 16-bit words to 
        be spliced into the object code.  Its argument is a chain of zero 
        or more expressions separated by commas.  If a comma occurs with 
        no preceding expression, a word of $0000 is spliced into the 
        code.  The word is placed into memory high byte in low address, 
        low byte in high address as per standard Motorola order.  The 
        sequence of bytes $FE $FF $00 $00 $01 $02 could be spliced into 
        the code with the following statement:

                       FDB       $FEFF, , $0102


        4.6  Pseudo-ops -- IF, ELSE, ENDIF

             These three pseudo-ops allow the assembler to choose whether 
        or not to assemble certain blocks of code based on the result of 
        an expression.  Code that is not assembled is passed through to 
        the listing but otherwise ignored by the assembler.  The IF 
        pseudo-op signals the beginning of a conditionally assembled 
        block.  It requires one argument that may contain no forward 
        references.  If the value of the argument is non-zero, the block 
        is assembled.  Otherwise, the block is ignored.  The ENDIF 
        pseudo-op signals the end of the conditionally assembled block.  
        For example:

                       IF   EXPRESSION     ;This whole thing generates
                       FCB  $01, $02, $03  ;  no code whatsoever if
                       ENDIF               ;  EXPRESSION is zero.

        The ELSE pseudo-op allows the assembly of either one of two 
        blocks, but not both.  The following two sequences are 
        equivalent:

                       IF   EXPRESSION
                       ... some stuff ...
                       ELSE
                       ... some more stuff ...
                       ENDIF









                                       11



             TEMP_LAB  SET  EXPRESSION
                       IF   TEMP_LAB NE 0
                       ... some stuff ...
                       ENDIF
                       IF   TEMP_LAB EQ 0
                       ... some more stuff ...
                       ENDIF

             The pseudo-ops in this group do NOT permit labels to exist 
        on the same line as the status of the label (ignored or not) 
        would be ambiguous.

             All IF statements (even those in ignored conditionally 
        assembled blocks) must have corresponding ENDIF statements and 
        all ELSE and ENDIF statements must have a corresponding IF 
        statement.

             IF blocks can be nested up to 16 levels deep before the 
        assembler dies of a fatal error.  This should be adequate for any 
        conceivable job, but if you need more, change the constant 
        IFDEPTH in file A685.H and recompile the assembler.


        4.7  Pseudo-ops -- INCL

             The INCL pseudo-op is used to splice the contents of another 
        file into the current file at assembly time.  The name of the 
        file to be INCLuded is specified as a normal string constant, so 
        the following line would splice the contents of file "const.def" 
        into the source code stream:

                       INCL      "const.def"

             INCLuded files may, in turn, INCLude other files until four 
        files are open simultaneously.  This limit should be enough for 
        any conceivable job, but if you need more, change the constant 
        FILES in file A685.H and recompile the assembler.  


        4.8  Pseudo-ops -- ORG

             The ORG pseudo-op is used to set the assembly program 
        counter to a particular value.  The expression that defines this 
        value may contain no forward references.  The default initial 
        value of the assembly program counter is $0000.  The following 
        statement would change the assembly program counter to $F000:

                       ORG       $F000

             If a label is present on the same line as an ORG statement, 
        it is assigned the new value of the assembly program counter.






                                       12



        4.9  Pseudo-ops -- PAGE

             The PAGE pseudo-op always causes an immediate page ejection 
        in the listing by inserting a form feed ('\f') character before 
        the next line.  If an argument is specified, the argument 
        expression specifies the number of lines per page in the listing.  
        Legal values for the expression are any number except 1 and 2.  A 
        value of 0 turns the listing pagination off.  Thus, the following 
        statement cause a page ejection and would divide the listing into 
        60-line pages:

                       PAGE      60


        4.10 Pseudo-ops -- RMB

             The RMB (Reserve Memory Bytes) pseudo-op is used to reserve 
        a block of storage for program variables, or whatever.  This 
        storage is not initialized in any way, so its value at run time 
        will usually be random.  The argument expression (which may
        contain no forward references) is added to the assembly program 
        counter.  The following statement would reserve 10 bytes of 
        storage called "STORAGE":

             STORAGE   RMB       10


        4.11 Pseudo-ops -- SET

             The SET pseudo-op functions like the EQU pseudo-op except 
        that the SET statement can reassign the value of a label that has 
        already been assigned by another SET statement.  Like the EQU 
        statement, the argument expression may contain no forward 
        references.  A label defined by a SET statement cannot be 
        redefined by writing it in column 1 or with an EQU statement.  
        The following series of statements would set the value of label 
        "COUNT" to 1, 2, then 3:

             COUNT     SET       1
             COUNT     SET       2
             COUNT     SET       3


        4.12 Pseudo-ops -- TITLE

             The TITLE pseudo-op sets the running title for the listing.  
        The argument field is required and must be a string constant, 
        though the null string ("") is legal.  This title is printed 
        after every page ejection in the listing, therefore, if page 
        ejections have not been forced by the PAGE pseudo-op, the title 
        will never be printed.  The following statement would print the 
        title "Random Bug Generator -- Ver 3.14159" at the top of every 
        page of the listing:

                       TITLE     "Random Bug Generator -- Ver 3.14159"

        5.0  Assembly Errors

             When a source line contains an illegal construct, the line 
        is flagged in the listing with a single-letter code describing 
        the error.  The meaning of each code is listed below.  In 
        addition, a count of the number of lines with errors is kept and 
        printed on the C "stderr" device (by default, the console) after 
        the END statement is processed.  If more than one error occurs in 
        a given line, only the first is reported.  For example, the 
        illegal label "=$#*'(" would generate the following listing line:

             L  0000   FF 00 00      =$#*'(     CPX       #0


        5.1  Error * -- Illegal or Missing Statement

             This error occurs when either:

             1)   the assembler reaches the end of the source file 
                  without seeing an END statement, or

             2)   an END statement is encountered in an INCLude file.

             If you are "sure" that the END statement is present when the 
        assembler thinks that it is missing, it probably is in the 
        ignored section of an IF block.  If the END statement is missing, 
        supply it.  If the END statement is in an INCLude file, delete 
        it.


        5.2  Error ( -- Parenthesis Imbalance

             For every left parenthesis, there must be a right paren-
        thesis.  Count them.


        5.3  Error " -- Missing Quotation Mark

             Strings have to begin and end with either " or '.  Remember 
        that " only matches " while ' only matches '.


        5.4  Error A -- Illegal Addressing Mode

             This error occurs if the index register designator X is used 
        with a machine opcode that does not permit indexed addressing or 
        if the immediate designator # is used with an opcode that does 
        not permit immediate addressing.

        5.5  Error B -- Branch Target Too Distant

             The 6805 relative branch instructions will only reach -128 
        to +127 bytes from the first byte of the next instruction.  If 
        this error occurs, the source code will have to be rearranged to 
        shorten the distance to the branch target address or a long 
        branch instruction that will reach anywhere (JMP or JSR) will 
        have to be used.


        5.6  Error D -- Illegal Digit

             This error occurs if a digit greater than or equal to the 
        base of a numeric constant is found.  For example, a 2 in a 
        binary number would cause a D error.  Especially, watch for 8 or 
        9 in an octal number.


        5.7  Error E -- Illegal Expression

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a missing expression where one is required

             2)   a unary operator used as a binary operator or vice-
                  versa

             3)   a missing binary operator

             4)   a SHL or SHR count that is not 0 thru 15


        5.8  Error I -- IF-ENDIF Imbalance

             For every IF there must be a corresponding ENDIF.  If this 
        error occurs on an ELSE or ENDIF statement, the corresponding IF 
        is missing.  If this error occurs on an END statement, one or 
        more ENDIF statements are missing.


        5.9  Error L -- Illegal Label

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a non-alphabetic in column 1

             2)   a reserved word used as a label

             3)   a missing label on an EQU or SET statement

             4)   a label on an IF, ELSE, or ENDIF statement

        5.10 Error M -- Multiply Defined Label

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a label defined in column 1 or with the EQU statement 
                  being redefined

             2)   a label defined by a SET statement being redefined 
                  either in column 1 or with the EQU statement

             3)   the value of the label changing between assembly passes


        5.11 Error O -- Illegal Opcode

             The opcode field of a source line may contain only a valid 
        machine opcode, a valid pseudo-op, or nothing at all.  Anything 
        else causes this error.


        5.12 Error P -- Phasing Error

             This error occurs because of:

             1)   a forward reference in a EQU, ORG, RMB, or SET 
                  statement

             2)   a label disappearing between assembly passes


        5.13 Error S -- Illegal Syntax

             This error means that an argument field is scrambled.  Sort 
        the mess out and reassemble.


        5.14 Error T -- Too Many Arguments

             This error occurs if there are more items (expressions, 
        register designators, etc.) in the argument field than the opcode 
        or pseudo-op requires.  The assembler ignores the extra items but 
        issues this error in case something is really mangled.


        5.15 Error U -- Undefined Label

             This error occurs if a label is referenced in an expression 
        but not defined anywhere in the source program.  If you are 
        "sure" you have defined the label, note that upper and lower case 
        letters in labels are different.  Defining "LABEL" does not 
        define "Label."

        5.16 Error V -- Illegal Value

             This error occurs because:

             1)   the first argument of a bit manipulation instruction is 
                  not 0 thru 7, or

             2)   the second argument of a bit manipulation instruction 
                  or the first argument of a read-modify-write 
                  instruction is not 0 thru 255, or

             3)   an immediate value is not -128 thru 255, or

             4)   an FCB argument is not -128 thru 255, or

             5)   an INCL argument refers to a file that does not exist.


        6.0  Warning Messages

             Some errors that occur during the parsing of the cross-
        assembler command line are non-fatal.  The cross-assembler flags 
        these with a message on the C "stdout" device (by default, the 
        console) beginning with the word "Warning."  The messages are 
        listed below:


        6.1  Warning -- Illegal Option Ignored

             The only options that the cross-assembler knows are -l and  
        -o.  Any other command line argument beginning with - will draw 
        this error.


        6.2  Warning -- -l Option Ignored -- No File Name
        6.3  Warning -- -o Option Ignored -- No File Name

             The -l and -o options require a file name to tell the 
        assembler where to put the listing file or object file.  If this 
        file name is missing, the option is ignored.


        6.4  Warning -- Extra Source File Ignored

             The cross-assembler will only assemble one file at a time, 
        so source file names after the first are ignored.  To assemble a 
        second file, invoke the assembler again.  Note that under CP/M-
        80, the old trick of reexecuting a core image will NOT work as 
        the initialized data areas are not reinitialized prior to the 
        second run.







                                       17



        6.5  Warning -- Extra Listing File Ignored
        6.6  Warning -- Extra Object File Ignored

             The cross-assembler will only generate one listing and one 
        object file per assembly run, so -l and -o options after the 
        first are ignored.


        7.0  Fatal Error Messages

             Several errors that occur during the parsing of the cross-
        assembler command line or during the assembly run are fatal.  The 
        cross-assembler flags these with a message on the C "stdout" 
        device (by default, the console) beginning with the words "Fatal 
        Error."  The messages are explained below:


        7.1  Fatal Error -- No Source File Specified

             This one is self-explanatory.  The assembler does not know 
        what to assemble.


        7.2  Fatal Error -- Source File Did Not Open

             The assembler could not open the source file.  The most 
        likely cause is that the source file as specified on the command 
        line does not exist.  On larger systems, there could also be 
        priviledge violations.  Rarely, a read error in the disk 
        directory could cause this error.


        7.3  Fatal Error -- Listing File Did Not Open
        7.4  Fatal Error -- Object File Did Not Open

             This error indicates either a defective listing or object 
        file name or a full disk directory.  Correct the file name or 
        make more room on the disk.


        7.5  Fatal Error -- Error Reading Source File

             This error generally indicates a read error in the disk data 
        space.  Use your backup copy of the source file (You do have one, 
        don't you?) to recreate the mangled file and reassemble.


        7.6  Fatal Error -- Disk or Directory Full

             This one is self-explanatory.  Some more space must be found 
        either by deleting files or by using a disk with more room on it.

        7.7  Fatal Error -- File Stack Overflow

             This error occurs if you exceed the INCLude file limit of 
        four files open simultaneously.  This limit can be increased by 
        increasing the constant FILES in file A685.H and recompiling the 
        cross-assembler.


        7.8  Fatal Error -- If Stack Overflow

             This error occurs if you exceed the nesting limit of 16 IF 
        blocks.  This limit can be increased by increasing the constant 
        IFDEPTH in file A685.H and recompiling the cross-assembler.


        7.9  Fatal Error -- Too Many Symbols

             Congratulations!  You have run out of memory.  The space for 
        the cross-assembler's symbol table is allocated at run-time using 
        the C library function alloc(), so the cross-assembler will use 
        all available memory.  The only solutions to this problem are to 
        lessen the number of labels in the source program, to use a 
        larger memory model (MSDOS/PCDOS systems only), or to add more 
        memory to your machine.
