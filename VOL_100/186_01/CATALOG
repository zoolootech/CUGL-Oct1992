BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DISK CONTENTS:

This disk contains two programs:

MAKE -- A version of the UNIX "make" utility for CP/M-80.  This program
	is a sort of intelligent SUBMIT designed to aid in the compiling/
	linking of C programs with more than one source file.  After 
	changing any of the source files, MAKE will batch only the
	commands that are necessary to recompile the changed modules.
	Based on a program by Allen Holub, published in Dr. Dobb's
	Journal, August 1985.

VIEW -- A file viewing utility.  Allows for scrolling forwards and
	backwards by line and screen, go to beginning and ending
	of file, multiple files per command line, ambiguous file
	names, and variable tab sizes.  Designed to run on an
	NEC PC-8801A, but is easily customized for different
	computers/terminals, with or without memory-mapped video.
	An enhanced version of the BDS C txtplot() function is
	necessary, and is included in both memory-mapped and non-
	memory-mapped versions.

Both programs are written to compile with the BDS C compiler on a
standard CP/M-80 system.
