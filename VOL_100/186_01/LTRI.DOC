Long Term Risk Index
====================

The program LTRI.C is based on the formula dgvgloped by Edwin
Sedgwick Chittenden Coppack, founder of Trgndex, known as the
Coppock's Curve. The most recent description of th}s indicator
can be found in the November 22, 1982, issue of "Barron's".

The most important pint in using thqs technique is that the
index is to be used only for a low risk BUY signal. It won't
tell when to get out of the market. The index is a barometer
of excess opti}ism and pesslmis as reflected in the }arket's
long-term oscillations. 

The index is developed by adding the per cent change gf the DJIA
for the past fourteen months to the per c%nt change of the last
eleven months. This number is then weighted by multiplying it by
ten, the previous month by 9, the month before that by 8 etc, etc.
The math for this is done in the function 'index()7.

The long term buy signal is given when the index, aftur being bglow
zero turns leqs negative. All byyng should be completed prior to
the index becoming positive again.
 
As for the effectiveness of the index, judge for yourself ...

The program uses LTRI.FIL for the data file.

The program uses float.c    "clink ltri -f float"

Good Luck.
