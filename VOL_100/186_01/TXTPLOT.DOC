DOCUMENTATION FOR TXTPLOT FUNCTION:

Version 1.1 -- 6/14/85


Revisions:

1.1 -- (JWP, 6/14/85) Added parity stripping, skipping of controls, and
       variable tab size.

TXTPLOT.CSM is a replacement for the txtplot function in the BDS C library.
BDS C has 5 library functions for memory-mapped video: 

	setplot(base,xsize,ysize)
	clrplot()
	plot(x,y,chr)
	txtplot(string,x,y,ropt)
	line(c,x1,y1,x2,y2)

Although setplot and plot work OK for the 8801A, txtplot, clrplot and line 
do not work at all.  Simply doing a putch(0x1a) will take care of clrplot,
and line is not a very useful function, anyway.  But txtplot, which maps
a string at a given set of screen coordinates, is great for using in 
editors and the like, so I have written a replacement that works well
on the 8801A.

USAGE:

There are some changes to the format of a txtplot call.  The old version
worked like this:

	void txtplot(string,x,y,ropt)
	char *string;
	int  x,y,ropt;

where string is a pointer to the string to be plotted, x and y are the
coordinates to plot at, and "ropt" was supposedly a flag to toggle
reverse video.  This function was designed for a memory-mapping scheme
where the lines on the screen were mapped end-to-end in memory, and 
a parity bit set indicated reverse video.  On the 8801A, this won't
work, since each screen line is followed in video ram by 40 bytes
of attribute information.  When the old txtplot function tries to
wrap a line around column 80, on the 8801A, it will wreak havoc with
your video attributes.

The new format is as follows:

	int txtplot(string,x,y,tabsiz)
	char *string;
	int  x,y,tabsiz;

At its simplest, the new txtplot rectifies this situation by simply refusing
to plot text past column 80.  I could have done it with wrap-around, but
chose not to since in the applications I use it with, one line of text
must occupy only one line on the screen.

The new txtplot does more than the old, however.  To facilitate its use
in word processing applications, I added the following features:

	(1)  Strings may now be terminated by either a null or by
	     a carriage return (0x0d).  This means you can just pass
	     it a pointer to a regular C character string, or you
	     can pass a pointer to a line of a standard text file.

	(2)  All control characters (with the exception of tabs) are
	     ignored in the plotting.

	(3)  All characters have their parity bit stripped before mapping.
	     (2) and (3) combined will allow for WordStar files to be
	     properly mapped.

	(4)  The new txplot expands tabs.  The "tabsiz" variable is
	     the factor for tab expansion, allowing variable tab sizes.

	(5)  The "ropt" flag has been removed altogether.  Setting video
	     attributes on the 8801A requires a different strategy.

	(6)  The old txtplot did not return anything.  The new version 
	     returns the number of the last column mapped to.  This can
	     be helpful if you want to relocate the cursor after mapping
	     a line.
