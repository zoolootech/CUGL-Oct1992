REVISIONS TO MAKE.COM

Code by Allen Holub and James Pritchett


Version 1.0 -- 10/28/85

-- Adaptation of A. Holub's MK (for MS-DOS) for CP/M-80 and BDS C.
-- Added command line options, and default disk macro.  
-- Other slight changes to program structure.


Version 1.1 -- 12/06/85

-- Added support of user areas in file searching.
-- Added default user area macro.  Added macro() function for
   future expansion of macros.
-- Added code to handle public files (a la Plu*Perfect) properly.
-- Added code to allow nested SUBMITS.
-- Used a linked-list stack instead of an array to store batched
   commands, thus allowing unlimited number of batched commands
   and simplifying some code.
