                  D/ED: A DISK EDITOR FOR CP/M 

     D/ED  is a program that allows the user to edit directly the 
contents of a diskette.   The purpose of writing D/ED was to pro-
vide a program with the functional nature of DU.COM (in the  pub-
lic  domain) and the ease-of-use that DPATCH (a copywritten  pro
gram) allows.

     The  program  is as of this date (3/3/85) dedicated  to  the 
public  domain in the tradition of "freeware".   If you have  the 
desire to make a donation for the program, send it to:

     If  there  are changes or additions that you would  like  to 
make to the code,  please send your suggestions to me so that the 
program can be kept up-to-date.  Thank you.

     D/ED allows a person to:
          1. Alter the contents of tracks and sectors
               by hexadecimal or ASCII input.
          2. Move tracks and sectors around the disk
               or just keep them in storage buffers.
               There are 8 buffers.
          3. Print the contents of a sector in ASCII-HEX
               format to either a disk file or to the
               system LST: device.
          4. Analyze the disk sub-system, giving block
               size, number of sectors/track, tracks/disk,
               and total disk space.

     To  use  D/ED,  simply  select the option displayed  on  the

THE COMMANDS

     As  you can see,  most of the commands are fairly simple  to 
follow.

     Type in "Q" to quit.
             "+" to go to the next SECTOR.
             "-" to go to the previous SECTOR.
             "0" to go to the 0-SECTOR of the present track.
             "2" to go to the MIDDLE of the present track.
             "Z" to ZAP the sector with E5's (hex).
             "W" to WRITE the displayed sector to the DISK.
             "E" to EDIT the contents of the sector.
                    Then enter the requested offset in DECIMAL.
                    To enter HEX values, just type in the value.
                    To enter any ASCII character, type "#" before
                         the character to be entered.
                    To cease EDITing, enter a "."
             "C" CALL
                    Place the displayed sector in a buffer.
                    Enter a number from 1 to 8.
             "R" RECALL
                    Get and display a sector from a buffer.
                    Enter a number from 1 to 8.
             "B" Go BACK 1 track.  If at track 0, then to the
                    last track.
             "A" Go AHEAD 1 track.  If at the last track,
                    then to track 0.
             "H" Send the disk drive head HOME. (Track 0,
                    sector 0)
             "T" Select a TRACK.

     There really is nothing difficult about the capabilities  of 
the program.  Just follow the instructions and you should have no 
problem using it.

VIDEO CONTROL SETUP

     The  screen handling is presently set up for a TeleVideo 920 
terminal (on my Osborne I).  You can change the configuration and 
then recompile the porgram.
