If you are a first-time user of RBBS4, you do not need to use UTLX.

UTLX is a program used to convert RBBS 4.0 USERS.CCC and .MSG
files to RBBS 4.1 format.  This is required because the new
format individual user records have to be reorganized to hold the
full name as one field, AND to initialize the new areas to hold
the last message seen variables.  The .MSG files also need to be
converted to reorganize the summary records to hold the new full
name FROM and TO fields.

UTLX has NOT been idiot-proofed.

The following is the recommended procedure for using UTLX:

A.  Copy all your name.MSG files to name.OLD and USERS.CCC to
USERS.OLD for backup.

B.  Fix USERS.CCC, if necessary, using DDT to examine and repair
    the file:

    1.  DDT USERS.CCC
    2.  Note the ending address and subtract 0180H from it.
    3.  The high byte of the resulting value is the partial value
        of the total number of user records.  If the low byte is
        80H, add one to the partial value to get the actual
        value.
    4.  Dump the first record.  If the value displayed for the
        MAX REC in ASCII is the same as the computed value, ^C
        out of DDT and go to Step C, else do step 5.
    5.  If the computed value does NOT match the displayed value,
        modify the value, exit DDT, and save the appropriate
        number of pages into USERS.CCC

C.  Run UTLX in the following order:

    1.  First, select the option to convert the USERS.CCC file.
        This runs essentially the same as the UTIL function to
        clean up the USERS.CCC file, offering each user record,
        one at a time until all user records have been processed.

    2.  Select the option to convert a .MSG file.  This works
        essentially the same as the UTIL function to clean up a
        .MSG file, offering each message, one at a time.

That's it.  You're done.  If you made a mistake or had a problem,
(such as not writing a message you meant to keep), you can exit
UTLX, recopy the backup, and reconvert that file, and continue.
