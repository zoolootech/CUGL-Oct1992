[READ-ME of JUGPDS Vol.18]

                    Comments on Vol.2 of 2 of
             Software Tools in BDS C by H. Katayose
                           prepared by
                 Yoshio MONMA (JUG-CP/M Disk Editor)

     This  volume  should be used in conjunction with  JUGPDS  Vol.17,
because  some of files needed to compile and link the source  programs
have been omitted to save disk space.  They are:

	DEFF3.C (actually you will need DEF3.CRL)
	PAT.C (PAT.CRL is required to link FIND0 and CHANGE)
	DEF.H
	STDIO.H

     You  can modify and recompile the source program of the Tools  of
JUGPDS Vol.17 and 18 with BDS C package.  Prior to  compile  and link, 
you  must make sure to be accessed (included or linked)  these  files.  
For further detail read SWTOOLS.DOC of JUGPDS Vol.17.
