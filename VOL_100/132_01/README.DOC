1.0   6809 C compiler
 
	Pertinent Files:
		canew.c		"new" version of first compiler segment
		cb.c
		cd.c
		ce6809.c	Code generator for 6809
		bldc.sub	Submit file to build compiler using
		cdef.h		The required header file. BDSCIO.H is
				also required.
				BDS C version 1.41 or better
 
1.1	To make it:
		You must have a functioning version of BDS C on drive A.
	Move the submit file bldc.sub onto drive A with this
	disk in drive B. Submit bldc. If all goes without error, you
	will need to answer the questions at the end of the link phase
	as to which files must be searched. Input canew in response
	to the first question, cb to the second, ... , ce6809 to the
	fourth and the link should complete leaving canew.com on 
	drive B. You will probably need double density drives (1/2 meg)
	to build on drive b or will have to shuffle the compilation and
	link operations.
 
1.2	To run it:
		syntax: canew <CR>
 
		The compiler will ask about defining global symbols
			(say Y, it seems to work).
		The compiler will ask about emitting the source lines
			as comments in the assembly output. Handy for
			debugging and they may be stripped out later
			with STRIP.
		The compiler will ask about the source file name.
		The compiler will ask for the output file name.
		The compiler will ask what number the assigned labels
			should start at. Your choice unless merging
			a previously compiled output.
 
		After all this information, the compiler will chug along
		and emit an assembly file possibly with errors.
 
		The implementation on the 6809 uses the linked D register
		as the primary and the X register as the secondary. The
		code generator has been modified in some cases to be 
		more efficient in indirect addressing which the 6809 
		directly supports. If one is to seriously use this 
		compiler, I would recommend that all back issues of 
		Dr. Dobbs be scrutinized for bug fixes which I may have
		missed. The compiler is meant to be run on an 8080/Z80
		machine in the CP/M environment using BDS C. It will
		not correctly self-compile into a 6809 host without
		modification because:
			1. Small C handles some expressions differently
			   than BDS C
			2. The byte order for 16 bit words is reversed
			   on a 6809 relative to an 8080. The compiler	
			   assumes a certain order in some cases.
		Not that it is impossible to port, but don't expect
		it to work without some tinkering.
 
 
1.3	Assembling the compiled code:
 
		The first version of the compiler worked with a 6800
	assembler found in a DECUS library modified to run with BDS C.
	The byte order for the 6809 was correct and some of the 6800 
	instructions even had the same opcodes. 6809 instructions were
	built by FDB and FCB pseudo-ops. This may be seen in the
	runtime package RUN6809.A69. Boy, was that tedious! Later versions
	used a 6809 cross assembler (SORCIM's) which expedited the 
	assembly and standardized on real 6809 opcodes. 
 
		You must include the run time package RUN6809.A69 in
	the assembly file. You may bring it in automatically by 
			#ASM
			#INCLUDE  RUN6809.A69
			#ENDASM
	in the c code or append it to the compiler output. #INCLUDE
	operations in the c code are recommended (see SHOOT1.C).
 
		The size of the assembled code can be problematic in
	terms of disk space required and time. The utility STRIP.C
	has been provide to strip out all comments. The files LIB
	and RUN are merely stripped files of COLORLIB.A69 and 
	RUN6809.A69 respectively. The stripped files are then run
	through your assembler or may be prestripped and included in
	the c code in the case of standard functions ( ie LIB and RUN).
 
1.4	Running it in the Color Computer:
 
		Your Color Computer should have at least 16k bytes of
	ram for running any reasonable C program. The demonstration
	programs shoot.c and shoot1.c require 32k bytes. The lower 
	16 k bytes is dedicated to the base page, stack, and two 6 kb
	display pages in these programs. To down load files into the
	Color Computer, the serial input bit is used with a down load
	program. On the host side, you will require some sort of 4800
	baud interface and a program to dump the 6809 hex object file
	through this port. SERIO.C is the supplied driver on the host
	side which runs with a UART. DLOAD is a 6809 assembly language
	program for use on the Color Computer side. (by the by... Radio
	Shack names EVERYTHING TRS-80 regardless of internal machinery.
	I believe the smaller color computer uses a 6805 processor
	which will not work with the supplied compiler).
		The first question is "How do I get it into my color
	computer?". This is (unfortunately) a Catch-22. The assembly
	file DLOAD has been provided which, when assembled, will read
	a Motorola "S" record hex file into the Color Computer's memory.
	Once DLOAD is correctly in memory, it may be used to load
	hex object files like... DLOAD. Obviously, one would save DLOAD
	on cassette or disk once it was input.
	You may:
		1. Obtain someone's version of a loader which is 
		   supplied on a media you can read directly.
		2. Assemble DLOAD and via BASIC poke your way into
		   a working loader from the assembly listing.
		3. Write your own loader.
		4. Give up. It really is too tough anyway.
 
	Having done both #2 and #3, it won't take that long to get it
	rolling. 
 
		Make note of the runtime library COLORLIB.A69. It 
	shows how to handle the clock interrupt, quickly sample the
	joystick positions and fire buttons, and setup the graphics
	chip (VDG). For machine debugging, the Editor-Assembler rom
	pack supplied by Radio Shack is well worth it if you have
	no resident tools. If you have a CP/M system (you must to
	get this far!) then you do not need the Radio Shack disk.
	DLOAD runs at 4800 baud and is adequate for small programs.
 
 
2.0	Graphics Driver
 
  2.1 Overview
 
 	An object oriented graphics driver written in C with assembler
support has been provided on this disk. 
 
	Pertinent files:
			cwriter.doc -	Describes how the it works
			shoot.c		Simple target demonstration
			shoot1.c	Chase demonstration
			pass0.c		first pass list processor
			pass1.c		second pass list processor
			pass2.c		last pass list processor
			shoot.h		game header file
			graph.h		graphics driver c header
			prelude		assembly file for entry and
					exit to c code
			shootini.c	Initializtion routines. 
					Primarily for driver lists.
			shoot.gph	Object library
			Colorlib.a69	Color computer support library
					and machine language section
					of graphics driver.
			LIB		Stripped version of Colorlib.a69.
			RUN6809.a69	Runtime assembly file for C
			RUN		Stripped RUN6809.A69
 
2.2	COLORLIB.A69
	
	COLORLIB.A69	contains the lowest level graphics primitives
which will erase or write an object. A move is merely an erase followed
by a write in the new location. COLORLIB.A69 is front ended by the
application (shoot.c or shoot1.c) and the list driver (pass0-2). It 
may be used by itself to splat objects on the screen with gay abandon
but it will not check for overlaps and has no list processing. Test 
objects are supplied in SHOOT.GPH.
 
 
2.3	Graphics Driver Operation
 
	The graphics driver acts upon the supplied lists (master and
page update) and calls the various passes. This implemtation uses two
display pages to avoid flicker during update. The undisplayed page is
updated while the user sees a constant display on the visible page. Then
they are switched and the process repeats. The master list contains
all the information about what is on the screen as well as other status
such as time remaining before an object is blanked or unblanked. All
objects are resident in the master list and each display page list.
The sequence of objects in all three lists must be identical. The intent
of the master list is that it would contain not just graphic paramters
such as position or object matrix but object action as well. 
The sequence of operations for shoot and shoot1 is:
 
		1. Scan the master list and  call each procedure 
		   defined in the master object records. The  
		   procedures will update the master list.
			procedure
				prcall
					<various graphic procedures>
 
		2. Update the undisplayed page list from the updated
		   master list. Wait for the desired number of clock
		   ticks to pass before swapping pages. The graphics
		   on the screen will be made to track the master list.
			display
				cwriter
					pass0
					pass1
					pass2
				setscrn
 
2.4	Pass0, pass1, pass2
 
 	These are the three passes over the displayed page and master
lists which update the graphic objects:
 
  2.4.1 Pass0
	Pass0 tests if an object requires updating. Possible states are:
		Blanked to Unblanked
		Unblanked to Blanked
		Moved.
	When pass0 completes, the state of the displayed page list 
	is correct for each object assuming no object interactions. A
	possible interaction would be to blank or erase an object 
	behind a stationary object which would erase all or part of the
	foreground object. Pass0 erases objects which require update
	by directly calling eraseobj().
 
  2.4.2 Pass1
	Pass1 checks for object interactions like the one mentioned. The
	degenerate case is where all objects must be erased and
	rewritten. Pass1 will add to the list of objects which must be
	updated due to overlap considerations. Pass1 checks each object
	against every other object in the list and therefore is time
	consuming. It is possible to avoid pass1 if there is 
	sufficient intelligence in the higher level software to 
	avoid overlaps. A possible case would be in player-missle
	games where if the player and missle overlap, they are 
	replaced by one object .. an explosion.
 
  2.4.3 Pass3
	Pass3 is the calling function for object writes. It loops 
	through the displayed list  and calls writeobj().
 
2.5	Object Definition
 
	See the file SHOOT.GPH for details. Objects are dual byte
	lists with a header. All objects are blocked within the smallest
	enclosing rectangle. Each byte within the rectangle is 
	defined for on pixels as well as masked pixels (holes). The mask
	is applied by eraseobj() to only erase the active parts of
	the object. The mask also allows pixels defined by multiple
	bits (2-3) to be correctly erased.
