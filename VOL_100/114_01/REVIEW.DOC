Reviewed by Nick Hammond

          The January 1982 edition of Dr Dobbs Journal (if you
don't read it, stop whatever you are doing now and take out
a subscription) carried an article by Edward K Ream, describing
his screen editor written in Small C and available from the
BDS-C Users Group for those like me who were too lazy to
type it in.  The Group is now offering a slightly modified
version compatible with Leor Zolman's BDS-C compiler.
The new version offers simpler compilation and faster operation
without loosing any of the power or advantages of the original
editor.

Compilation

          This is straightforward.  The BDS
compiler is used to compile each of the nine sub-files which
make up the program (actually there are more than 9 but the
remainder are #included).  CLINK is then used to link the
resulting .CRL files and the runtime library.  The disk
contains two SUBMIT files to do this and I have added an
'idiots guide' giving step by step instructions on what files
must be on what disks before you start.

          It is possible to compile the editor using
a single disk system since there is room for the source
.CRL and .COM files on one eight inch single density drive with
the compiler or linker.  The Small C version could be done on a
single drive but it would be a major task - the .ASM and .HEX
files alone require over 200K and you would be forever swapping
disks during the process.

          Apart from space, the BDS compiler is considerably
quicker.  On my slow 2MHz Z80 system (but with track buffered
drives) the whole process took around 15 minutes as compared
with over 30 for Small C.  This is not really important if you
are just going to compile the editor and use it.  If you have
changes in mind, however, the additional speed and the ability 
to separately compile and link modules will make life much
easier.

Changes

          The changes to the editor to produce compatibility
with BDS-C are relatively minor - adaption for #includeing
the global #defines and the external declarations as header
files with BDSCIO.H to allow separate compilation of each
module and some small syntactical changes.  It is a tribute
to the utility of both compilers that such a change
can be relatively easily made.

          One of the syntactic changes was to replace the
bitwise operators & and | with the connectives && and ||
in relational expressions.  This caused me to discover what
appears to be an error in the Version 1.41a BDS-C compiler
or runtime package I was using.  Number() in ED9.BDS contains
the expression ((c<'0')|(c>'9')) and in the review copy the
| had not been replaced by ||.  The compiled editor would
not accept numeric arguments, thus disabling the goto <line>
function, until I had changed the operator to || and
recompiled the offending module.

          Since the result of either operation should be
identical, this appears to be an error in version 1.41a.
As the editor documentation advertised it for use with
a version 1.43 or later compiler, this error has presumably
been fixed.  I have, however, changed the remaining
bitwise operators to their more efficient alternative where
applicable.

Performance

          The size of the compiled .COM file was almost exactly
the same in the two versions.  The BDS version is 23K and the
Small C version 22.5K.  Performance, however, gives the edge
to BDS.  I did only some very cursory measurements, but the
BDS version appears to run about 25% faster for CPU bound
functions.  Since they are both slow, this is important.  For
example, it took my steam powered Z80 14 seconds to search for
a single character through the ED10 file with BDS but 19 with
Small C - both of these are too slow but that extra five
seconds seems very long.  In his DDJ article, Ed Ream
recommends a 4MHz processor and I concur.

          I don't intend to say anything about the operating
characteristics of the editor for the simple reason that
text editors are a subject, like religion, surrounded by
mystical beliefs and dogma and totally unsuited to
rational discussion.  Like any other editor, You will either
love it or hate it but in this case you do have a choice.
Since Ed has generously placed the source code
in the public domain, you can change it!  More important - 
because he has provided well designed and documented
code, changing it should be both a pleasure and an educational
experience.  

Recommendation

          If you need a capable screen editor for general use,
want to be able to modify it to suit your particular
preferences, or would just like to experiment with a well
structured C program, the Ream editor at $8.00 is outstanding
value.  If you have access to a BDS-C compiler, this version
will give you an editor which is easier to produce and runs
a little faster.  If not, the original Small C version is quite
acceptable and you get a working Small C compiler thrown in for
free.
