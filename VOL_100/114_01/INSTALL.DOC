   This document tells you how to get the
screen editor up and running on your system.
To do this you need the following:

.nf
1.  A CP/M version 1.4 or 2.2 operation system which
    runs on an 8080, Z-80 or 8085 based computer.

2.  An 8 inch single density floppy disk drive.

3.  At least 48K of central memory.

4.  A video display which has a goto x,y cursor
    positioning function.
.br
.fi

   To get the screen editor up and running on your
system all you need to do is follow these 5 steps.

.ul
Step 1:  Back up the diskette.

   Make a backup copy of your diskette.
Do it now.

.ul
Step 2:  Run the configuration program

   Start the configuration program by typing 'config'
from CP/M.

   The configuration program tailors the screen editor for
your particular keyboard and display screen.
The configuration program asks you three sets of questions.
After you finish answering all the questions the configuration
progrm creates two files which describe your keyboard
and video display.
These two files are included into the screen editor during
step 3.

   The first set of questions ask you what keyboard
keys you want to use for each special function that
the editor uses.
To answer each question you may type either a decimal
number or a carriage return.

   If you type a carriage return the configuration
program will use the default key.
The configuration program will tell you what the
default value is for each key.
I recommend that you use the default value
unless your keyboard does not have the default key.

   If you type a decimal number instead of a carriage
return then you are indicating that you wish to
use the key whose ascii code is the same as that
decimal number.
For example, suppose the configuration program
asks you for the value of the left key.
If you type (say) 11 as a response this means
that the control-k key will be used as the left key.

   Note that the values you enter should either
be less than 32 or be equal to 127.
Avoid values greater than 127 or less than 0.

   After you answer all these questions you
will be asked if all the answers are correct.
If you say no, then you will be asked the same
questions over again.

   Note that you can always use the normal
CP/M line editing functions if you make
a mistake in typing a line.
Also, you can leave the configuration program
by hitting control-c any time that the program
asks for input from you.

   The next set of questions asks what special
built-in functions your display screen has.
Answer each question with a yes or a no.
You may use the letters 'y' or 'n' for yes or no.

   Again, after finishing the questions you will
be asked if you are satisfied with your answers.
If not, type 'no' and you will be given another chance.

   The third and last set of questions asks you
to supply the actual characters that you must
output to your display screen to get the screen
to do the special functions you said it had.
For each special functions, you will be asked to
enter those bytes one at a time.

   For example, let us start with the goto x,y
special function.
This is the only special function that your
display MUST have in order to use the screen editor.
Now suppose that in order to move the cursor to
ROW y and COLUMN x you must output the escape
character (27) followed by an equal sign, followed
by the 32 plus x, followed by 32 plus y.
To do this you would type the following:

.nf
Enter byte 1:  27
Enter byte 2:  '='
Enter byte 3:  x+32
Enter byte 4:  y+32
Enter byte 5:  (return)
.br
.fi

   Note that you type a carriage return to stop entering
bytes.

   Be
.ul
sure
that you enter the row and column numbers in the order that
your terminal expects.
(Many terminals use a sequence in which the row and column
numbers are reversed from the sequence shown above).

   If you do make a mistake in the goto xy sequence
then the screen will not look at
all like it should
when you run the editor in step 5.

   When you have finished with this last section
you will be asked whether you are ready to
create two files.
If you say yes and the configuration program will
erase the two files if they already exist,
create the two files, and then exit.
If you say no the configuration program will exit without
doing anything.
Say yes unless you don't want to erase existing versions
of the two files.

.ul
Step 3:  Compile the editor

   Next, compile the editor using the BDS C compiler.
Either version 1.43 or 1.44 will work.
You will need to compile ed2.bds through ed10.bds,
including ed6.ccc.
The submit file edcomp.sub will do it all at once.

   If you get an error you may have made a mistake
when you typed in the sequences of bytes for the
configuration program.
Such an error will show up when the compiler is compiling
the file ed6.ccc.
If there is an error on file ed6.ccc you must redo step 2.

   Something is wrong with the files on your
disk if you got any other error.
No error you can make using the configuration
program should cause an error which shows up in any
file except ed6.ccc.
Get a fresh copy of the disk from your backup
diskette and start over again from step 2.

.ul
Step 4:  Link the editor

   Use the BDS C clink program to create ed2.com.
The file edlink.sub shows how to call the linker.

.ul
Step 5:  Test and use the editor

   You are now ready to use the editor.
Invoke the editor by typing 'ed2' from CP/M.
It should clear the screen, draw the prompt line at the
top of the screen and tell you what version you are using.

   If that doesn't happen you probably gave the configuration
program the wrong information about the goto x,y cursor
function.
When you specify the goto xy function remember:
x means the COLUMN number, y means the ROW number.
Make
.ul
sure
you have specified the row and column numbers in the order your
terminal expects.
Take a deep breath and repeat steps two through six.

   If the screen looks reasonable, try out all the commands
from the user guide.
Be sure to check whether the hardware screen scrolling
is working properly.

   Note that the configuration program can not handle keyboard
keys that produce more than one character.
If you want to use such keys you will have to modify the file
ed2.bds.
Then, of course, you will have to recompile and link
the new editor.
I recommend that you get the editor working before you attempt
to modify it.

NOVICES GUIDE TO COMPILING AND LINKING
.nf
 - only if you are using CP/M version 1.4, use ED or
   some other editor to comment out the version 2.2
   syscstat(), syscin() and syscout() routines in
   ED8.BDS and uncomment the equivalent version 1.4 routines
 - copy the editor source files and the submit files to	
   an empty disk (PIP A:=B:ED*.* will do it).
   add a copy of BDSCIO.H, the compiler (CC?.COM), linker
   (CLINK.COM), runtime package (C.CCC), library (DEFF?.CRL)
   and finally SUBMIT.COM.
 - boot the system with this disk in drive A and type
   submit edcomp.
 - get a cup of coffee.
 - if all is well, type submit edlink and finish your
   coffee
 - the resulting editor will be called ed2.com

   good luck!
