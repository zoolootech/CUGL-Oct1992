CREDITS -- GAMES I

	Most of these files contain the author's name and instructions
right at the beginning. I will only speak to the others here. 

EUCLID and POLISH came from a disk containing programs by H. Moran. 
I am not sure whether Moran wrote them or whether someone else wrote
them and they were combined with Moran's work before I got them.

JOTTO, XWORD, & IQUIZ are the work of Dave Fogg. I'm not personally
familiar with these games, so I will pass on what he offered when
submitting the disk (a fine one too, I might add--see KWIC, etc on
UTILITIES Vol I.):

"...the games...are all VERY Heath/Zenith Z-19 terminal oriented, but
they should work on any smartish terminal by modifying STD.H for one's
terminal.

"Data Files: JOTTO.WDS is a wordlist for JOTTO; IQUIZ.DAT is a question
file for IQUIZ; *.ANS are corssword/clue files for XWORD. They are all
text files, modifiable with your favorite text editor. The format of 
JOTTO.WDS is simply: one 5-letter word per line. IQUIZ.DAT consists of 
seven-line groups, where the first 3 lines are the question, and the
last 4 are the "answers", the first answer being the correct one 
(IQUIZ shuffles answers on the screen). Note that the question MUST
make up 3 lines, using empty lines if necessary. The structure of an
XWORD.ANS file is best determined by looking at one of them.

"Of course, all programs require the presence, during compilation/
linking, of my STD.H and DMF.CRL (compiled DMF.C) files.

"The programs are commented pretty well at their beginnings as to
what they do & how to use them; the game programs are not so well
documented that one can learn how to play the games therefrom: a 
knowledge of the game in question is a prerequisite. JOTTO prints a 
(somewhat cryptic) command summary on the screen, as does XWORD;
IQUIZ is pretty straightforward if you just run it, tho I might
mention the scoring/penalty algorithm: the score downcounts from 100
in the upper right corner; hitting the correct answer key adds the
count at that instant to your score for the round; the FIRST 
incorrect response takes the instantaneous value & halves it 
immediately, then continues; the SECOND wrong guess sets the count
directly to zero; however it gets there (by penalty or timing out),
when the count reaches zero, the correct answer is hilited in inverse
video."

If you find a bug and FIX it, or find a way to make the programs more
universal AND IMPLEMENT IT, please send a copy to me. It is probably
wise to call first...no point in shipping a disk if it's already been
done.
