	These programs were published in the Nano-Pico Quize Columns of 
BIT (The computer science magazine, Kyoritsu Publ.).  Source programs were
written in Fortran-80. The Japanese documentation will be appeared in 
JUG-CP/M Newsletter Vol.2, No.4. November, 1985.

   Language: Fortran-80, Programmer: S. Kihira
   Required memory: 10K

  I/O: Console [O] 

  Source: bit, March 1978.

Question: Find combinations of four integers (1,2,6,9) which will
          result in between 70 and 90 (both included) by arthmetic.

Q1: Make the table for the function:
		g(n) = 2**(log n), 1 <= n =<105.
Q2: Find g(52), g(53), and g(105).

Note by T.O.: Exact solution for Q2 is not possible by Fortran-80.
