Bill,
	Here are a few C programs that may be of interest,
particularly revised versions of your SCRUB and UNSCRUB for
the Aztec CII compiler under CP/M-80. CHIS16.C is a general
purpose statistical analysis program for 2x2 tables, while 
CLOCK.C and CLSET.C access the real time clock on a Teletek
FDC-I.  These last three are original and are public domain.a
STARTIM.C is an adaptation of Julian Hyde's program
STARPRI which adds the ability to calculate time between 2
dates from a file in Datastar format.  As far as I know 
STARPRI is public, and certainly my additions are.

					Cheers,

					Alan Coates.
