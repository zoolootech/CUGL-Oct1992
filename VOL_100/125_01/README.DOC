Each C source file on this disk is documented inside the
file according to the C Users Group specifications.

All other files are documented in the HEADERS.DOC
file found on this disk. 

The programs provided on this diskette are
primarily concerned with implementation
of libraries to control cursor movement
on a variety of video devices.  The
files LIBVT52.C and LIBO1.C are examples
of just such libraries.  The files
VTTT.C and DEFLECT.C are rewrites of 
games which make use of the above libraries.
To generate an executable version, first
create a .CRL file using the compiler,
then link in the usual way, specifying the
library for the target terminal.

clink vttt libvt52

would create the file VTTT.COM for use
with a VT-52 terminal.  Likewise, the command

clink vttt libo1

would create the file VTTT.COM for use
with the Osborne 1.

	The file NRO.COM is a word processor
similar to ROFF and WP.  The sources were not
included because of the similarity, and because
the others are probably more complete implementations.
NRO.COM is included to allow processing of manual
pages which document the programs provided.
Each of the libraries have manual pages, and
each of the standard functions from the libraries
have manual pages.  The format for these manual
pages is similar to that used in the Unix
environment.  The file NRO.NRO is the manual page
input to NRO which describes NRO.COM.  The
file NRO.MAN is the result of processing NRO.NRO
by NRO.COM.
