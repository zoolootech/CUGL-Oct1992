nro - text processor
.sp
SYNOPSIS
.br
.ti +5
nro inputfile [outputfile]
.sp
DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +5
NRO is a text processor and formatter based on the design
provided in Software Tools by Kernighan and Plauger.
The text and commands found in inputfile are processed to
generate formatted text.
The output may be directed into a file if outputfile is present
in the command line; otherwise, the output will appear at
the user console.
Commands are distinguished by a period in column one of the input
followed by a two character abbreviation for the command funtion.
The abbreviation may then be followed by an optional numerical
argument.
The numerical argument may be an absolute value such as setting
the right margin to a particular column, or the argument may be
preceded by a plus sign or a minus sign to indicate that the
parameter should be modified relative to a previous setting.
The following commands are recognized:
.sp
.in +5
.br
.ti -5
bp - begin page causes succeeding text to appear at the top of
a new page.
The optional argument specifies the page number for the new page.
The default value is one.
.sp
.ti -5
br - break causes succeeding text to start on a new line at the
current left margin.
There is no numerical argument for this command.
.sp
.ti -5
ce - causes the next line of text to appear centered on the output.
The optional argument specifies if more than one line is to be centered.
.sp

fi - fill causes the input text to be rearranged to obtain the
maximum word count possible between the previously set left and
right margins.
No argument is expected.
.sp
.ti -5
fo - specifies text to be used for a footer.
Leading blanks may be recognized by preceding them with a quotation
mark.
The absence of footer text indicates that a footer should not be printed.
The presence of the character '#' in the text yields the current page number.

The format is the same as for the footer.
