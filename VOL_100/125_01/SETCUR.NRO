DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +5
SETCUR generates the appropriate code sequence to cause the
cursor to be moved to the character position described by the
parameters X and Y.
This routine considers the display screen to occupy the first
quadrant of the X,Y coordinate space.
As such, cursor position 0,0 is located in the lower left corner
of the display area.
It should be noted that most terminals address the cursor in terms
of a row and column address rather than an x,y position.
The row,column addressing tends to place the display screen in the
fourth quadrant and although this may be useful for text applications,
it seems cumbersome for graphics applications.
