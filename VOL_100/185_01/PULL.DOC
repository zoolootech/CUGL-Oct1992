10/08/85   PULL.C   Program to extract 1 file from a Novosielski .LBR file

	There is probably no one else in the universe who will use this
program except for myself. So be it. But do you ever need to yank just 1
file from a library (say m7lib from modm700 to install a new number
library)? If so, you may find this program useful. Given the same kind
of command line LTYPE uses, it will extract any single file from a
library and put in on the default drive with the same name. It can have
a single file on disk while I am still waiting for LBRDISK, NULU, LU etc.
to load.

	Command syntax: PULL LIBNAME FILENAME<cr> will extract filename
from libname (if it doesn't exist, you are so informed) and will write
the new file on the default drive. Any existing file of the same name
will be overwritten, natch, so caution is in order.

	Credit where credit is due dept: The original program is
Sigi Kluger's LTYPE which was modified to standard C (from BDS) by
Pete Mack for MS/PCDOS. Whereupon I brought it back to a real
computer (CP/M) and Aztec C 1.06d in its present form.
