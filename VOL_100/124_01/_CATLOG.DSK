This disk contains programs from two authors. The first
group of programs was submitted by Mike Meyer.
It is the source for the small tex system, including
all documentation and fonts. To use tex, you must have the Fancy
Font system from SoftCraft, and an Epson MX-* printer. tex is a
text formatter that uses pfont vs 1 (from Fancy Font) as a
printer, and makes it fairly easy to use the magic that Fancy
Font puts in your hands.
