                                  Introduction


      These trig functions were developed so that I could do some auxiliary work

on scaling and curve generation for a graphics package I'm now doing in BDS-C.

They seem to work OK in my setup which is now:  

       o  Altair 8800b, 64K CPM 2.2 BDS-C vers 1.42 

       o  Tarbell SSSD 4 8 inch disk 

       o  Scion Microangelo 

       o  LSI ADM3A 

This package was developed by:

                            REVISION 1 13 JULY 1981


      The CTRIG programs have been revised to take advantage of the ability to

insert '\0' into string constants which make it possible to use string constant

as pseudo-static floating point constants.  In addition, the values of the

constants have been revised to improve performance.  An added arctangent

function arctan2() has been added to allow quadrant detection for arctangents.

The test software "TESTTRIG" has been improved in format, and tests added for

arctan2().  



      These programs are written in BDS-C using the floating point package

modified to add truncation and magnitude functions.  This package is called

"FLOAT+44".  The following functions are mechanized:  





                                        1









     char *sine(result,angle) 

     char *result, *angle;   /* usual [5] char arrays for fp */ 

          The angle input argument is in radians, within the bounds of the

          floating point variable.  The function returns the pointer to the

          result.  

     char *cosine(result,angle) 

     char *result, *angle;   /* as with sine */ 

          Identical to the sine 

     char *tangent(result,angle) 

     char *result, *angle;    /*as with sine */ 

     char *arctan(angle,datum) 

     char *angle, *datum;    

          This returns the angle in radians.  Error conditions, such as too

          small or large a datum return "end value" angles.
