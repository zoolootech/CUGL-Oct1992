cb.c:
	Swiped from the CIPG's UNIX system and modified to run
		under BDS C by William C. Colley, III
	Updated to BDS C, v1.44 by Rick Hollinbeck, 9/28/81
chario.c:
	Written 1980 by Scott W. Layson
	This code is in the public domain.
cp.c:
	Makes a copy of a file in the current directory (easier
	than doing a pip). Written by LZ. Uses the "usercode" library.
meta4.*
	These programs were published in Doctor Dobbs Journal, August 1981.
	They were originially written in PIDGIN.  Transplanted to BDS C by:
	Jan Larsson, Kosterv. 12, S-181 35 Lidingo, SWEDEN
l2.c:
	New linker for BDS C
	Written 1980 by Scott W. Layson
	This code is in the public domain.
	This is an improved linker for BDS C CRL format.  It eliminates the
	jump table at the beginning of each function in the object code,
	thus saving up to 10% or so in code space with a slight improvement
	in speed.  
MAKOVL.C:
	Overlay builder/manager
	This code is in the public domain.
	Created from L2.C 81.10.29 Gyro
	This is a variation on L2.C that creates relocatable overlays
	according to an overlay descriptor file.
noboot.c:
	by Leor
scott.c:
	Scott Layson's personal miscellaneous-function library
	This code is in the public domain.
	Created from functions in STDLIB?.C 81.10.29 Gyro
usercode.c:
	Idea: Extend the filename syntax for user with ALL file I/O to
	      allow a user area prefix of the form "n/" on all filenames.
	Written by Leor Zolman, 12/81
