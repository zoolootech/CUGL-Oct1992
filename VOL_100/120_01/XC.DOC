Robert ..

	I would like to contribute the 'C' cross-reference program
contained on this disk to the BDS C Users Group Library .. I have
already ported it to the MIT Artificial Intelligence system so Leor
is aware of its existence .. would appreciate it if this diskette
would find its way home .. hope all is well with BDSCUG .. have not
heard from you folks for a while!
