PROGRAM:
     CLEAN  - Cleans up a text file, can indicate bad characters.
USAGE:
     CLEAN  [<fid] [-I] [-H] [>fid]
FUNCTION:
    
    This cleans up a number of problems with text files. It can 
    operate in two modes.  In the default mode, control characters 
    are stripped out, characters with high order bits on are 
    stripped, tabs are expanded, lines too long are split, naked CR's 
    are converted to CR NL pairs and files without ending CR NL get 
    them.  Both kinds of CP/M end-of-files are handled and a true EOF 
    character put at the end. Also, trailing blanks are stripped from
    lines.
    
    IF the -I option is used, control characters, including tab, will 
    be indicated by a ^ preceding the character plus hex 040.  Thus, 
    a tab will become ^I.  Characters with the high order bit on will 
    be preceded by a ~.  The character is stripped of its high order 
    bit and the processed as normally.  Thus, a tab with the top bit 
    set would come out as a ~^I.  In order to show the true ~ and ^, 
    they are doubled so that a ^ is shown as a ^^.
    
    The -H option lists the available options.

    EXAMPLE:
     CLEAN  <DIRTY >CLEAN	{Cleans up a dirty file.}
     CLEAN <DIRTY -I		{Shows the dirty characters in a file.}
