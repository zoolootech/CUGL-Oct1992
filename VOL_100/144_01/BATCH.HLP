PROGRAM:
    BATCH is intended as a replacement program for SUBMIT.COM provided
    with CP/M by Digital Research Corporation.  It uses files with the 
    tags .BAT rather than .SUB.
USAGE:
    BATCH [<fid] [arg1] [arg2] ... [arg9]
    BATCH fname [arg1] [arg2] ... [arg9]
    BATCH / [arg1] [arg2] ... [arg9]
FUNCTION:
    BATCH creates A:$$$.SUB which is used by CP/M as a command
    stream.  It has the following features.

    	1) Null input lines are properly interpreted; they cause
	   the creation of a zero-length line in $$$.SUB.
	2) BATCH jobs may be nested to any level.
	3) BATCH with no arguments or file specification will 
	   supply a menu of available .BAT files on the current 
	   disk and the A: disk.
	4) An interactive mode (/ form of command) allows command 
           lines to be entered directly.
	5) A stream of batch commands may be supplied from a
	   pipe from the Van Nuys Bridge Toolkit or from a file
	   via redirection ( ... |BATCH ...   or BATCH <file.bat ...)
	   Argument substitution may still be done and in the latter 
	   case, other tags than .BAT may be used.
	6) Lines beginning with a "*" are treated as comments.
	7) The parameter $0 gives the batch file name.
	8) The parameter $# gives the number of args including
	   the file name. (i.e. BATCH ECHO, where ECHO.BAT is
	   ECHO $#, gives ECHO 1)
	9) The parameter $* gives the list of all arguments.
       10) BATCH commands may be nested indefinitely in .BAT files.
       11) Typing BATCH with no arguments will give a menu of available 
           .BAT files on both the current disk and the A: disk.
       12) Interactive mode may be aborted by typing control-C as the 
           first character of a line.  Also, all normal CP/M editing 
           characters are available.
       13) A $ may be entered by using two $'s together, or a $ followed 
           by a non numeric character.
       14) BATCH works properly when invoked from other than the A: 
           disk.
       15) Both the current disk and then the A: disk are searched for
           the .BAT file.
       16) XSUB works with BATCH just as it does with SUBMIT.
       17) Control characters may be entered by preceding a alphabetic
    	   character with a ^.
