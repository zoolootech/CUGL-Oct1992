PROGRAM:
    PAGE - Formats text into pages with file headers and page
     numbers.
USAGE:
    PAGE [<fid] afn ... [-Ln] [-W] [-N] [-P] [-H] [>fid]
    
FUNCTION:
    This can act either as a filter or a source.  If the command line 
    contains filenames, these files are read, formatted, and titled. 
    Afn's may be used for these file names. Each file will 
    start on a separate page, and each page will be filled out.
    
    The standard page length of 66 lines is assumed unless otherwise
    specified by the "-Ln" option.  Six lines of each page are used 
    as white space, and header.  The -Ln specification should give 
    the full page size (e.g. 66).
    
    The -W specification will cause the program to wait at the
    beginning of each page.  Hitting a CR will cause the next page
    to be output.  This is for "paging" through output on a screen, 
    or to use with a cut paper printer.
    
    The -P (plain) specification eliminates the page numbering 
    and headers, and just puts 3 blank lines at the beginning and end 
    of each page.
    
    The -N specification adds line numbers to each files as it is
    copied.  Each file is line numbered separately.
    
    The -H specification lists the available options.
    
    If there is directed input, either from a pipe or from a file, 
    this input is also formatted at the end of any of the files 
    obtained from the command line specifications.  Under no 
    circumstances will this program accept input from the normal 
    keyboard input path.  This allows it to be used as a simple 
    source when no directed input is used.
    
EXAMPLE:
    PAGE *.HLP -L22 -W
    PAGE F1 F2 F3 >FALL
    PAGE <FILE >LST:
