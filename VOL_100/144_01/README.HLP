Hello,

You have in your possession a copy of the Van Nuys TOOLKIT plus
some interesting other tools which I built for my own
convienence.  These tools are donated to the public domain by
me for non-profit distribution and use.  

The source is BDS C 1.5 version compatable. You should have the source
for all the tools, my version of WILDEXP, my version of DIO.C, my
BDSCIO.H, and my DIO.H.  The source has been formatted using the 
included tools CB and CASE. I prefer to use BEGIN/END instead of { 
and }.  I also prefer to have C keywords in uppercase. Defines in 
my BDSCIO.H take care of this convention.

I have included C.COM.  This extracts the compile instructions
from the named .C file and builds a CP/M submit file on the A: 
disk.  To get started you should put cc1.com, cc2.com, clink.com,
c.com, bdscio.h, dio.h, dio.c and wildexp.c on a disk.

Do a:

            C DIO
then a:
            C WILDEXP
            
This should compile these libraries into DIO.CRL and WILDEXP.CRL.

Then you can compile the various tools by bringing in the source
and repeating the process.  If there is any serious problem with the 
toolkit, it is that they take up about 1/2 megabyte for all the 
.COM files.  It is much better if you have a a hard disk.  Still,
you can pick and chose which tools you are likely to use the most and
just keep them in order to keep the storage down.

Use HELP for assistance.  TOOLKIT.HLP contain information on 
redirection and pipe options

I have used these tools a great deal and hope that they are
useful to others as well.  If you like them let me know.  If you
don't like them don't bother. After you are getting them free.

As a start, put together LS and 2UP first.  Then try:

           LS *.* | 2UP -N5L20W

You should get a nice column sorted directory.  Try:

           LS *.* | 2UP -N5L20W +file

And it will got to both the file and the screen.

Good Luck and Best Wishes,
