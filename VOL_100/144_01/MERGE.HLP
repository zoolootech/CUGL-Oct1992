PROGRAM:
    MERGE - Merges two sorted files together in various ways.
USAGE:
    MERGE [<fid] fid [-U] [-R] [-Cn] [-Ln] [-D] [-I] [-F] [-H] [>fid]
FUNCTION:
    This program merges two sorted files and produces various
    combinations in the output stream.
    The default is to do a straight forward merge of the standard 
    input with the named file on the command line to the standard 
    output.
    
    Options are:
    -D  Output only lines found in both files
    -I  Output only lines in the standard input which do not
        match lines in the named file.
    -F  Output only lines in the named file which do not
        match lines in the standard input.
    -R  Reverse sort order.
    -U  Convert to upper case before compare.
    -Cn Column position to start compare. (Default 1.)
    -Ln Maximum length of compare. (Default whole line.)
    -H  Display the available options.
EXAMPLE:
    SORT <LTLFILE |MERGE BIGFILE >NEWFILE
COMMENTS:
    Options -I and -F may be used together to get all lines
    not in common.  This REQUIRES that no repeated lines exist in
    either file.  UNIQUE may be used to eliminate repeated lines.
    
    Trying to merge two files which were not sorted the same way or 
    not using the same sort criteria (i.e. -C, -L, -R, -U) will not 
    give you the desired result.
