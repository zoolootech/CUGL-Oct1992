PROGRAM: 
    HELP is a menu driven utility designed to simplify 
    retrieval of misc text. 

USAGE: 
    HELP [name] [>fid] 

FUNCTION: 
    If  a name is given, HELP locates on the current disk or the A: 
    disk, a file with the name name.HLP.  If no name is given, help 
    first gives a menu of the available files on the current disk and 
    the A: disk with the tag .HLP.  From this menu, a file may be 
    selected.

    If the file is "indexed" (See below) help then presents a menu of 
    index topics.  From this menu, a topic may be selected. Help then 
    presents the topic, in pages, to the screen, with a message at the 
    bottom indicating if there are more data available for that topic.

    If the file is not "indexed", help just presents the whole file 
    in pages.

    Within a help file, "indexed" files contain topic lines which 
    begin with a ":".  In indexed files, each topic should begin with 
    a : followed by a topic.  Topic lines should be short so that 
    they fit in the two column menu.

    Simple indexed files are searched for the topic lines to 
    construct the menu of topics.

    If an indexed file is very long, this search can be slow.  It is 
    possible to create a fast indexed file by preceeding the file 
    with all of the topic lines without, repeat, without the ":".  
    This index must correspond exactly with the order of the ":" 
    topic lines in the text.

    Non-indexed files must contain NO lines beginning with a ":".  No 
    topic menu will be built and the file will just be displayed in 
    pages.

    Within a topic or a non-indexed file, text is presented in pages. 
    If a lines is preceded with a ";", a page break will occur.  This 
    allows the text to be organized into reasonable pages.

    The ":" and the ";" are stripped from the lines when presented. 
    If the text is column dependent, remember that these will be 
    stripped off. There is no restriction on the characters in the 
    body of text itself. Only the first character is checked for ":" 
    or ";".
