PROGRAM:
    SORT - Sorts a file on a specified key
USAGE:
    SORT [<fid] [-R] [-U] [-Cn] [-Ln] [-H] [>fid]
FUNCTION:
    This program does an internal sort of up to 512 entries.
    Input and output are the standard redirectable input and
    output.  Options include:
    
    -R   Reverse order sort.
    -U   Convert to upper case before comparing.
    -Cn  First column to begin compare. 1 is default.
         It is ok to specify a position longer than some
         lines.  Lines shorter will compare as equal.
    -Ln  Length of field to compare.  Full line length is default.
    -H   Display the available options.
    
EXAMPLE:
    SORT <A -C10 -L10 -R
    WORDS <FILE |SORT |UNIQUE -N |SORT    {Gives word list by frequency.)
COMMENTS:
    This is an internal sort which uses the available space in memory.
    If the input file is too big, an out of space error will be given.
    
    The sort is "stable" and it is possible to sort on a less 
    significant field first and a more significant field second.
    Cascading sorts in this way can give sorts on complicated keys
    with some descending and some ascending.
