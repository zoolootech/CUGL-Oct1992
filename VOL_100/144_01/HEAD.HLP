PROGRAM:
    HEAD- Identifies and lists the first 10 lines of a list of files.
USAGE:
    HEAD afn ... [>fid]
FUNCTION:
    
    This accepts a list of file names either on the command line or 
    from the standard input.  File names in the command line may be 
    afn's. File names in the standard input may not be afn's. The 
    files are read in alphabetical order from the command line list 
    first, then, in order from the input list, if any.  As each file 
    is read, the file name is output, a blank line is output, the 
    first 10 lines of the files is output and 2 blank lines are 
    appended. This is similar to CAT in operation.
    
    Unless piping is used or the standard input is assigned to a file 
    (i.e. <file), only the command line arguments will be used as 
    file names.

EXAMPLE:
    HEAD *.HLP
    LS *.HLP |HEAD
    


        Command Line
