PROGRAM:
    SELECT - Select lines from a file based on a pattern search.
USAGE:
    SELECT [<fid] pattern [-X] [-N] [-A] [-B] [-H] [>fid]
FUNCTION:
    This searches the input for the supplied pattern and outputs
    the selected lines. The default is to output lines with the 
    pattern.  Other selection options are:
    
    -X	Select lines without the pattern.
    -A	Select lines including and after finding the pattern.
    -B	Select lines before the pattern is found.
    -N  Number selected lines with input line number.
    -H  Display the available options and metacharacters.
    
    Only one selection option may be used.
    
    The pattern is very general.  There are the following options.
    
    *	Any number of any characters, from 0 to 132.
    ?	Any single character.
    _	A space character.
    \	Literal character.  Used to include *, ? etc. in pattern.
    {	Beginning of line.
    }	End of line.
    @	Any alphabetic character.
    #	Any number.
    !	NOT  This may be used with any printable character, _,
    	{, }, @, and #, as well as \char forms.  This can be used 
    	to find	strings NOT at the beginnnin# or end of a line.
EXAMPLE:
    SELECT <PROG.C !;}          {Finds lines which don't end in ;}
    SELECT <TEXT {} -X >NEWTEXT {Removes empty lines}
    SELECT <PROGRAM.PRN ERROR   {Lists all lines containing "ERROR".}
COMMENTS:
    Because CP/M CCP converts all arguments to uppercase,
    this program does all its compares in uppercase.  "abc" will
    match "ABC" in all cases.
