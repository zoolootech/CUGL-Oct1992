Note: I'm not too proud of the structure of the graphics 
stuff here - it's too close to the peculiarities of one piece 
of hardware. When I get time I'll probably tear it up and redo 
it on the lines of GKS or CORE or NAPLPS, but for now I'd sure
like to know if anyone else out there is interested!

The graphics gadget used by some of this is based on the Texas
Inst TMS9918a chip - 256h x 192v pixels, 8 colors, 32 sprites,
16K local memory - there were construction articles in Byte 
and 80 Micro awhile back and several companies have advertised 
kits.
