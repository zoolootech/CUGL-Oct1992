	Inteface to Alpha Products NEWCLOCK-80 clock peripheral

The clock consists of 13 I/O ports addressed 0xB0 (176)
to 0xBC (188) inclusive, each holding a four-bit right-
justified integer. They represent seconds (0xB0), tens of 
seconds (0xB1), minutes (0xB2), tens of minutes (0xB3), 
hours (0xB4), tens of hours (0xB5), day of the week (0-6, 
0xB6), days (0xB7), tens of days (0xB8), months (0xB9), tens 
of months (0xBA), years (0xBB), and tens of years (0xBC).
Three of the ports also have special bits (within the right 
nibble) as detailed below.  Each port can be both read and 
written, but writing anything to either of the seconds digits 
(0xB0, 0xB1) clears both of them.  All values read or written 
should be AND'd with 0x0F.  

	The leap year, 12hr/24hr format, and AM/PM indication
(for 12hr format only) are handled by special bits in the tens
of days and tens of hours digits.  For leap year, bit 0x4 of 
port 0xB8 is zero normally and one if the NEXT February has 29 
days. (Omission of leap years on centuries not divisible by 
4 is probably not implemented - this will not matter until 
2100 AD!) Format and AM/PM are handled by bits in the tens of 
hours digit: Bit 0x8 of port 0xB5 is zero for 12hr format and 
one for 24hr format; bit 0x4 is zero for AM and one for PM 
(but only if bit 0x8 is zero).  All these special bits must be 
properly set when writing to their ports, or the modes will 
change!  Other unnecessary high-order bits (0xE in tens of 
months, 0x8 in day of week, tens of minutes and tens of 
seconds) simply read as zeroes. 

Port	Dec	Contents
0xB0	176	Seconds - cleared by any write to 0xB0 or 0xB1
0xB1	177	Tens (3 bits) - cleared as above
0xB2	178	Minutes
0xB3	179	  Tens (3 bits)
0xB4	180	Hours
0xB5	181	  Tens (2 bits)
		0x4: 0 = AM, 1 = PM (in 12hr format)
		0x8: 0 = 12hr format, 1 = 24 hr format
0xB6	182	Day of Week (3 bits)
0xB7	183	Day of Month
0xB8	184	  Tens (2 bits)
		0x4: 0 = normal, 1 = 29 days next Feb
0xB9	185	Month
0xBA	186	  Tens (1 bit)
0xBB	187	Year
0xBC	188	  Tens

Clock is a utility to display the time and date. It continually
reads the seconds digit of the clock and updates the display 
whenever the last digit changes.
