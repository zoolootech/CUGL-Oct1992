     NOTES ABOUT MODIFICATION TO PROGRAMS
	These modifications (trivial) and compilation/checkout
were done by:	L. C. Calhoun PE
		257 South Broadway
		Lebanon, Ohio 45036  <513> 932-4541/433-7510
The only change required was in ADVENT.H, to adjust the buffer
call outs to fit the standard BDS-C Version 1.43 utilities.
Compilation and Linking calls were changed to accomodate
the V 1.43 changes.  More notes will be found in ENVIRON.DOC.
The game was brought up, and played for a few minutes to ensure
that it was no worse than before.  I didn't have time to do
any checks on the game's performance as a game--but then I wasn't
asked to.  It behaved, for that short time, as did the original
ADVENT.COM on the disk from the BDSCUG.
The old COM files have been deleted, and the .C files replaced.
CRL, a new pair of submit files, and documentation files have been
added.
