     NAME        NAME 
          dsw - delete files selectively with prompting 

     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          dsw                                  dsw [-s] [filedesc] ...  

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          ___                                                                     Dsw is a program which lists a partial or entire directory, 
          one entry at a time, on the console and prompts for each 
          file to be deleted.  Optionally, the directory entries may 
          be sorted before prompting.  Zero or more file descriptors 
          (ambiguous or unambiguous) may be supplied to tailor the 
          output.  If no file descriptors are supplied, a default of 
          *.* is used, i.e.  everything on the current drive.  
          An answer of 'y' to the prompt will cause the file to be 
          deleted; anything else will cause the file to be kept.  

          The following option is available:
               -s     sort into alphabetic sequence before prompting

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.  

     EXAMPLES        EXAMPLES 
          dsw a:*.* b:*.*     lists everything on drives A & B, prompting
                              for deletion of each file. The files are
                              presented in directory sequence
          dsw -s *.com        lists all .COM files on the current default
                              drive in alphabetic sequence, prompting for
                              deletion for each one

     BUGS        BUGS 
          If the same file corresponds to more than one file 
          descriptor, it will be listed once for each such 
          correspondence.  
          A maximum of 128 filenames is allowed.
