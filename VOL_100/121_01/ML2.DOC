          ml2 - modified l2 linker for MP/M 

     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          ml2                                                                   ml2 {standard l2 files and options} [-r <runfile> <addr>] 

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          ___                                                                     ML2 is a version of Scott Layson's L2 linker which has been 
          modified to produce MP/M modules.  The only usage change is 
          the addition of the -r flag which will start the specified 
          runtime file at the specified address, then build the rest 
          of the module after it.  
          For further information on L2, see the L2 program 
          documentation.  

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program has not been tested by the librarian, due to 
          lack of the MP/M operating system.  No bug reports have been 
          received.  

     NOTES        NOTES 
          Requires chario.c for link.
