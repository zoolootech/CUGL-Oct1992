     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          TL370 is a modified version of Telnet v2.3, as distributed 
          with v1.46 of the BDS C compiler.  The modification consists 
          of the addition of optional XON/XOFF handshaking for file 
          transmission.  
          This program uses a modem to emulate a dumb terminal.  
          Incoming data may be buffered in memory and written to disk, 
          data may be transmitted from disk to the modem, or files may 
          be formally transferred in a "checksum" mode with automatic 
          handshaking and buffering.  

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.

     WARNINGS        WARNINGS 
          The checksum file transfer does not follow the XMODEM 
          protocol.  

     BUGS        BUGS 
          TL370 assumes that the CP/M console is much faster than the 
          modem (e.g. a 1200+ baud console with a 300 baud modem).
