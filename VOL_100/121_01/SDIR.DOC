          _S_d_i_r is a program to produce a sorted directory list on the 
          console, with four directory entries per line.  Zero or more 
          file descriptors (ambiguous or unambiguous) or drive 
          specifications may be supplied to tailor the output.  If no 
          file descriptors are supplied, a default of *.* is used, 
          which is everything on the current drive.  

     CCAAVVEEAATTSS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.

          sdir a: b:	lists everything on drives A & B. Each
          		directory is sorted individually.
          sdir *.com	lists all .COM files on the current default
          		drive.

          If the same file corresponds to more than one file 
          descriptor, it will be listed once for each such 
          correspondence.  
          A maximum of 128 filenames is allowed.
