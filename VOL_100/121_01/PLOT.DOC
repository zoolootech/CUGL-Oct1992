     NAME        NAME 
          plot - a package to use the dot-matrix abilities of the 
          Epson MX-80 line of printers 

     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          plot                                        plot [<infile>|-] [<outfile>|-] 

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          ____                                                                  Plot consists of a simple (demonstration) main() function 
          which drives some of the functions of the general-purpose 
          plotting package that is also contained within this file.  
          Main() reads in triplets of numbers from the file argv[1] 
          (or STDIN if argv[1] is `-' or missing) and plots them on 
          the file argv[2] (or STDLST if argv[2] is `-' or missing).  
          Each number triplet consists of x-coordinate, y-coordinate, 
          and a pen indicator (0=up,1=down).  The pen indicator may 
          also have the special values 2 (print the text string which 
          follows) and 9 (end the current plot and start a new one).  
          If there is no pen indicator, it is assumed to be down, 
          except for the first line of input.  A blank line terminates 
          input.  
          The file or STDLST is in a format for an Epson MX-80 with 
          Graftrax to plot these points via the graphics modes.

          This program has not been tested by the librarian, due to 
          lack of the appropriate hardware.  No bug reports have been
