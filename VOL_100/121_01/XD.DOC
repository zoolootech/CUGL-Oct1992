     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          __                                                                       Xd is a program to dump a file to the console in one or more 
          of three formats: ascii data, hex (2 digits/byte) or word 
          (standard 8080 format, assuming low byte first).  

          The following options are available:
               w - dump in word format (hex)
               b - dump in byte format (hex)
               a - dump as ascii
          The default option is -ba.

          In ascii, the following conventions are used to print special
          characters:
               control chars -         ^ followed by uppercase char
               high bit (0x80) on -    | followed by the character in the
                                       low 7 bits
               ctl char & 0x80 on -    $ followed by uppercase character
               del (0x7f) -            ^ followed by space
               0xff -                  $ followed by space

          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.
