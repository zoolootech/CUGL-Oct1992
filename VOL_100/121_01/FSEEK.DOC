     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          fseek               fseek()

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          _____                                                               Fseek consists of two routines: fseek and ftell.  These 
          provide Unix-like facilities for character seek & positional 
          query to BDS C programs.  
          Fseek is called with 3 arguments: filedesc, position, and 
          code.  Filedesc is the I/O buffer pointer, position is an 
          int saying where we want to be, and code tells how to 
          interpret position: 
               0     absolute, characters
               1     relative, characters
               2     from end, characters
               3     absolute, sectors
               4     relative, sectors
               5     from end, sectors
          Ftell is called with one argument, the filedesc (I/O buffer 
          pointer).  It returns the current position in th file.

          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.  

     EXAMPLES        EXAMPLES 
          fseek(file,0,0)     seeks to the beginning of the file

     BUGS        BUGS 
          Codes 2 and 5 for fseek are not implemented although they 
          exist in Unix V6.  The routine returns ERROR if called with 
          code 2 or 5.
