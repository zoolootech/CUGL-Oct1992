          ________                                                      filelist() converts ambiguous file descriptors to 
          unambiguous file descriptors.  

          ______                                                            nameok() takes an input file descriptor (ambiguous or 
          unambiguous) and creates a list of unambiguous file 
          descriptors in the supplied table.  

          _______                                                   pickout() extracts the name from a CP/M fcb.  

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          These functions were tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  They should work with other versions of BDS 
          C and CP/M, but have not been tested.  

     NOTES        NOTES 
          These functions are used by several programs on this disk, 
          including SDIR and ZDIR.  See the code for the parameters 
          required.
