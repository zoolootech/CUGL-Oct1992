          tel - dumb terminal emulator with file transfer 

     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          tel             tel 

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          Tel is a considerably modified version of Telnet v2.3, as 
          distributed with v1.46 of the BDS C compiler.  The following 
          features have been added: 
          (1) multiple files may be sent/received by one command 
          (2) directories may be listed 
          (3) the quit command hangs up a hayes smartmodem.  
          To accommodate these changes, some of the command names have 
          been changed.  
          This program uses a modem to emulate a dumb terminal.  
          Incoming data may be buffered in memory and written to disk, 
          data may be transmitted from disk to the modem, or files may 
          be formally transferred in a "checksum" mode with automatic 
          handshaking and buffering.  

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.

     WARNINGS        WARNINGS 
          The checksum file transfer does not follow the XMODEM 
          protocol.  
          Variable baud rate support is present, but commented out.  
          Hardware-specific coding would be required to implement it.  

     BUGS        BUGS 
          Tel assumes that the CP/M console is much faster than the 
          modem (e.g. a 1200+ baud console with a 300 baud modem).
