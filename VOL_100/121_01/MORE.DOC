     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          ____                                                                    More is a program which lists one or more files, a page (or 
          a user-selectable amount) at a time, on the console.  The 
          names of the files to be listed are supplied as arguments on 
          the command line; if no arguments are given, the user is 
          prompted for filename(s).  
          For each file, the first page's worth of lines is listed and 
          then the user is prompted with "more?  ".  At this point, 
          the following replies are accepted: 

                N            stop listing file, go on to next
          Y or (newline)     list next page
                S            list next half page
                0            go back to start of file, and list first page
               nnn           list next nnn lines
              -nnn           back up nnn lines, then list a page

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.  

     EXAMPLES        EXAMPLES 
          more abc.c xyz.dat    lists files abc.c and xyz.dat in turn
          more                  prompts for files to be listed

     BUGS        BUGS 
          Backing up nnn lines is only very approximate (it actually 
          backs up approximately nnn/3 sectors).  The only excuse for 
          this is to prevent the overhead of going back to the 
          beginning of a possibly large file and rereading most of 
          it.
