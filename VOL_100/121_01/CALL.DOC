          call - dial remote systems by name, using hayes smartmodem 

     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          call                                     call <sysname> [-|[command]] 

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          ____                                                                   Call is a program which uses the auto-dial features of the 
          hayes smartmodem to dial phone numbers by name.  It takes 
          one or two arguments.  
          The first argument is the name of the system that you want 
          to talk to.  This is compared with a list of names in the 
          file 'call.dat', and the corresponding phone number from 
          this file is selected.  
          The second (optional) argument is the name of a com file to 
          be run when the call is connected.  If this argument is 
          missing, the default com file ('telnet') is run.  
          Alternately, this argument may be a '-', which causes a 
          return to the ccp.  

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.

          call cnode -    calls the system named 'cnode', then returns to
                          the CP/M CCP
