          command line arguments if specified) when a conditional test 
          is met.  

          The following conditions may be tested:
          _________               ____ ___            Condition               When met
          -r filename             filename is readable, i.e. exists
          -w filename             filename is writeable, i.e. not marked R/O
          !(-r) filename          filename is not readable, i.e. does not exist
          !(-w) filename          filename is not writeable, i.e. is marked R/O
          str1 == str2            string 'str1' is the same as string 'str2'
          str1 != str2            string 'str1' is different from string 'str2'

          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.

          if -r a:data pip b:=a:data    if file 'a:data' exists, use pip to
                                        copy it to drive B

                                        'submit test lunk abc' won't clink abc
