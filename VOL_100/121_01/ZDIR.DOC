          zdir - produce directory list 

     SYNOPSIS        SYNOPSIS 
          zdir                                   zdir [-fs] [filedesc] ...  

     DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION 
          ____                                                                 Zdir is a program which produces a directory list on the 
          console, with six directory entries per line.  Optionally, 
          the output may be sorted and/or written to a disk file as 
          well.  Zero or more file descriptors (ambiguous or 
          unambiguous) may be supplied to tailor the output.  If no 
          file descriptors are supplied, a default of *.* is used, 
          i.e.  everything on the current drive.  

          The following options are available:
               -f     output filenames to file dir.dir
               -s     sort filenames before outputting

     CAVEATS        CAVEATS 
          This program was tested with v1.50 of the BDS C compiler 
          under CP/M 2.2.  It should work with other versions of BDS C 
          and CP/M, but has not been tested.  

     EXAMPLES        EXAMPLES 
          zdir a:*.* b:*.*     lists everything on drives A & B; both
                               directories are sorted together
          zdir -f *.com        lists all .COM files on the current default
                               drive and writes the list of files to dir.dir

     BUGS        BUGS 
          If the same file corresponds to more than one file 
          descriptor, it will be listed once for each such 
          correspondence.  
          A maximum of 128 filenames is allowed.  
          Unlike sdir, drive names on their own are treated as 
          requests for all-blank file descriptors.  

     NOTES        NOTES 
          Since this program combines the features of ddir & ldir, 
          these two programs have been removed from this version of 
          this diskette.  
          Requires files.c for link.
