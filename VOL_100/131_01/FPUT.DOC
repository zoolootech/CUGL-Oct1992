FPUT			File Copy Utility			FPUT

Copies a list of files onto a destination drive:


FPUT <drive> <filename> <filename> ...


The <drive> argument may be a user number, a drive specifier, or both
(e.g.  1/  B:  or  0/F:).  The <filename> arguments must not contain
any wildcard characters, but may have user number or drive prefixes.

If a <filename> begins with an '@', it is considered a catalog file,
and the default extension ".CAT" is appended if none is given.  Each
filename in the catalog is copied to the destination drive.  Any '@'
arguments within the catalog file are also expanded.  If the argument
consists of only an '@', then the default "FILES.CAT" is processed.
