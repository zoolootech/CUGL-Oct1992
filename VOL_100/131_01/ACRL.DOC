			    User Manual

			    7 Nov 1983




INTRO

    This assembler was written to provide a convenient means for assembly
language functions to be linked into a BDS C program.  The input file may
contain global symbol definitions and up to 64 functions.  One level of
file 'include' is provided.  The assembler generates a .CRL output file
ready for linkage with CLINK.



INVOCATION

    The command line format is:

A>ACRL <source file>[.<extension>] [-o] [-p] [-v]

    If no extension is specified, ".CSM" is appended to the source file
name.  The optional switches are:

	-o	do NOT generate an output file
	-p	print a listing on the console
	-v	list every byte generated (verbose)

The assembly may be aborted from the console by typing ^C.



SOURCE FILE FORMAT

    ACRL basically supports a subset of the standard Intel assembly
language.  The only extension is the function definition:

	<name>	FUNCTION  <func1>, <func2> ...
		.
		.
		.
		FEND

    <name> is the function name and must be 8 characters or less.
Following the FUNCTION keyword is an optional list of other functions
referenced, separated by commas.




ACRL PSEUDO OPS

INCLUDE		Include filenames must be enclosed in single quotes.
		Nesting is not allowed.

EQU		Symbols defined outside of any function are known to
		all functions.  Symbols defined within a function are
		local and may have the same names as local symbols in
		other functions.

SET		A local SET directive will refer to a previously defined
		global.  If not previously defined, it is local.

DB		Takes a list of 8 bit expressions.  Strings must be
		enclosed in single quotes.

DW		Takes a list of 16 bit expressions, any of which may be
		relocatable.

DS		Only one expression allowed.  Storage will be filled
		with zeros.

END		As usual.




EXPRESSIONS

    The following operators are supported (in order of precedence):

	-  NOT  HIGH  LOW  ()		(unary)
	*  /  MOD  SHL  SHR
	+  -
	AND
	OR  XOR

    Within a function, the dollar sign ($) has the value of the
location counter.  The standard relocation rules apply.




EXAMPLES

    The file TEST1.CSM contains sample usages of all operators and
pseudo ops.  TEST2.CSM contains every 8080 instruction (in opcode
order).  All the possible errors are generated in TEST3.CSM.
