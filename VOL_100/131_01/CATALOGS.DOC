Catalog files contain a list of filenames.  Their most common usage is
with the FPUT utility, to backup a group of related files.  Since
comments are allowed in catalogs, they also provide a useful document-
ation function.


File Format

Blank lines and any text following a semi-colon are ignored.  More than
one filename may be placed on a line, and spaces or tabs are delimiters.
By convention, catalog files have the ".CAT" extension.
