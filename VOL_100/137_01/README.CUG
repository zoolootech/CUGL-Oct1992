CUG-DDJ#1:

The files on this disk are the first year's collection of "C/Unix 
Programmer's Notebook" columns which were written by Anthony 
Skjellum.  They appeared in the September, 1983 through September, 
1984 DDJ issues. Importantly, this also marks the introduction of the 
first C Users Group DDJ collection volume.

The text files (.DDJ) were written with Wordstar.  Anyone
lacking this program will need to reset bit 7 of each
byte in the files so that they can be viewed correctly
on any system.
