The___ authors_______ 

   The original  version  of  this  program  was  written by
Richard Damon. Robert Ward rewrote the  program  and  called
it  DDNDISK.  Edward  K.  Ream  further  modified DDNDISK to
produce ANYDISK. Please send all reports of bugs to:

The___ commands________ 

   This program allows the operator to examine and modify  a
CP/M disk.  The commands available are: 

Bn  Set  current  track  and  sector to point at block n and
    enter block mode.  
Cn  Fill buffer with SIGNED value n.  
Dn  Set current disk number to  n  (0--#  of  drives-1)  and
    print disk information.  
Ea n n ... n    Edit buffer starting from location a. 
Fn  Fill buffer with UNSIGNED value n.  
H   Print help message.  
I   Convert  block  to  track  and  sector  and enter sector
    mode.  
M   Print the directory and the disk allocation map.  
N   Go to next block or track/sector.  
P   Print contents of buffer. 
R   Read sector or block into buffer (depending on mode).  
Sn  Set current sector to n (0--# of  sectors  per  track-1)
    and enter sector mode.  
Tn  Set  current  track  to  n  (0--# of tracks  per disk-1)
    and enter sector mode.  
W   Write sector or block from buffer (depending on mode).  
X   Exit program.  

Notes: 
1. Multiple commands may be specified on a line  except  for
   the  X  command  which  must  be  the only command on the
   line.  
2. Commands may be in upper or lower case letters.  
3. Spaces are ignored except in the  E  command  where  they
   are used as separaters for the numbers.  

Typical commands: 

d0t0s1rp        read in the track 0 sector 1 of 
                disk 0 (drive A) and print it.  

e1A 4F          set buffer location 1A to 4F and 
                set buffer location 1B to 20.

                buffer.  Note no space after last data byte.

b0rp            print the entire first block.  

b0irp           print the first sector of the first block.  


The___ disk____ allocation__________ map___ 

   The M command  prints  the  directory  in  two  sections.
Section  1  is  a  listing  of  each  directory  entry.  For
instance, entry 15 in the directory would be listed as: 

        15 = DDNDISK C:0 

The equal sign means the entry is valid.  A star  (*)  would
be  printed  instead  of  the  equal  sign if the entry were
deleted.  The number  following  the  colon  is  the  extent
number.  

   The second  section  is  a disk allocation map.  There is
one entry in this map for every block on the disk.   If  the
block  is  not  allocated  to any file, the characters "..."
appear. Otherwise, a number appears.  This number refers  to
the  number  of  the  directory  entry  which  allocated the
block.  Refer back to section 1 to see which file  allocated
the block.  


The___ structure_________ of__ a_ CP__/M_ 2_.x_ disk____ 

   Here is  a brief description of the CP/M 2.x disk format.
Several tracks are typically reserved for the bootstrap  and
a  copy  of  CCP and BDOS.  The number of reserved tracks is
determined by BIOS for each type of disk.   This  number  is
called  the  track  offset; it is printed by the 'D' command
when a disk is selected.  

   Most commands deal with the track  offset  automatically.
The  only  exception is the 'T' command.  When using the 'T'
command, you must add the offset yourself.   Thus,  you  can
access ANY track with the 'T' command.  

   Tracks following  the  reserved  tracks  store  data.  To
speed  up  disk  access,  CP/M  does  not  store   data   in
consecutive  sectors.   The  sector translate table converts
from logically consecutive sectors to the order  that  those
sectors  are  actually  stored  on the disk.  (This table is
used only on CP/M 2.x versions.) 

   All commands deal with LOGICAL sector numbers.   This  is
what  you almost always want.  Whenever a sector is printed,
both the logical and  physical  sector  numbers  are  shown.
Thus, if you can find any physical sector if you must.

   A block  is  the  smallest  unit  of  a disk which can be
allocated to a file.  The size of a block is a  multiple  of
128  bytes.   The  block size is determined by BIOS for each
type of  disk.   The  block  size  is  printed  by  the  'D'
command.  

   Several blocks  are reserved at the beginning of the disk
for the directory.  Again, the number of reserved blocks  is
determined  by  BIOS  for each type of disk.  This number is
also printed by the 'D' command.  

   The format  of  each  entry  of  the  directory   is   as
follows.  Each entry describes one extent of a file.  

byte   0    : file code : 0 if file exists, 0xe5 if deleted
bytes  1- 8 : file name : file name (ascii)
bytes  9-11 : file type : file type (ascii)
byte   12   : file ext  : extent number (binary)
bytes  13,14: unused
bytes  15   : rec count : count of number of sectors in extent
bytes  16-31: map       : list of blocks used by this extent

   Please note  that  byte 15 is NOT a reliable guide to the
number of blocks allocated to a file.  The way  to  tell  is
simply  to  count  the  blocks in the map.  Block 0 is never
allocated to any file and it signals the  end  of  the  map.
Remember  that  block  numbers  take  either  1  or  2 bytes
depending on whether there  are  less  than  256  blocks  or
not.  


Differences___________ between_______ DDNDISK_______ and___ ANYDISK_______ 

o  ANYDISK  uses  the  CP/M  2.x BIOS select disk routine to
   get the characteristics of the disk  dynamically.   Thus,
   different  kinds_____ of disks may be used without recompiling
   the program.  
   
o  ANYDISK  will  work  even  with  hard   disks.    Several
   arithmetic  statements  have been converted into loops in
   order to avoid overflow problems.  This also  means  that
   a  single  index variable can NOT be used.  Instead,  the
   current block, track and sector  numbers  are  maintained
   separately.  
   
o  The  code  that computes the disk map now needs lots less
   memory.  Only one disk block at  a  time  is  now  loaded
   into memory.  
   
o  The  disk map now is more readable.  The format is useful
   even for hard disks.  Directory entries which  have  0xe5
   for a file name are completely ignored.

ANYDISK                                        July 27, 1982


o  The   'D'   command   now   prints   a   summary  of  the
   characteristics of the selected disk.  
   
o  The 'H' command is new.  It prints a help message.  
   
o  The 'I' command is now useful for  printing  parts  of  a
   block.   For  example,  to  print just the 5'th record of
   block 20 use: 
   
           b20i nnnn rp 
   
o  The 'W' command now tells BIOS that  all  writes  are  to
   the  directory.   This  forces  BIOS  to  do the write at
   once.  
   
o  You get a more informative prompt if  you  type  a  value
   which is out of range.  
   
o  The  ptmap  routine  contains  two  constants,  M1COL and
   M2COL which control how many entries will be put on  each
   line  for  the  directory  list  and  the disk allocation
   map.  I use fairly small values because  my  screen  only
   has 64 columns.  Choose the constants you like best.
