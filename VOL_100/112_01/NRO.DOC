          ___                                                                     NRO  is  a  text processor and formatter based on the design
                        Software Tools                                             provided in  "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger.  The 
                                          ________                                text and commands found in the  ifile(s)  are  processed  to
          generate formatted  text.  The output may be directed into a
                                    _____                                         file or to the printer if ofile is present  in  the  command
          line;   otherwise,  the  output  will  appear  at  the  user
                                                                    P             console.  Directing the output to the special filename,  $P,
          will cause the output to be sent to the printer.  

               _                                               _                  The +n  option  causes the output to start with page n.  The
           _                                             _               -n option causes the output to stop after page n.  

               _                                                               The -v option prints the version number to the console.  

               _                                                                  The -p option causes the output to be shifted to  the  right
             __                                           po                       by xx spaces.  This has the same effect as the .po command.  

               _                                                                   The -b option allows backspaces to appear in the output text 
          when underlining  or overstriking.  This has the same effect
                  bs                                                as the .bs command with a non-zero argument.  

                _                                  _____                          The  -m  option  processes  the   file   mfile   for   macro
          definitions.   Note  that files processed in this way should
          contain only macro definitions, no immediate  output  should
          be generated from this file.  

          Commands  typically  are distinguished by a period in column
          one of the input followed by a  two  character  abbreviation
          for the  command  funtion.    The  abbreviation  may then be
          followed by an optional numeric or character argument.   The
          numeric  argument  may  be an absolute value such as setting
          the right margin to a particular column, or the argument may 
          be preceded by a plus sign or a minus sign to indicate  that
          the  parameter  should  be  modified  relative to a previous
          setting.  The following commands are recognized: 

          .bo - causes the following lines of text to appear in 
                boldface.  The optional argument specifies the number 
                of lines to be typed in boldface.  Boldface and 
                underlining are mutually exclusive features.  The 
                appearance of a boldface command will cause any 
                underlining to cease.  

          .bp - causes succeeding text to appear at the top of a new 
                page.  The optional argument specifies the page number 
                for the new page.  The initial value is one and the 
                default value is one more than the previous page 
                number.  

          .br - causes succeeding text to start on a new line at the

                current left margin.  There is no numeric argument for 
                this command.  

          .bs - enables or disables the appearance of backspaces in 
                the output text.  Underlining and boldface options are 
                implemented by inserting character - backspace - 
                character combinations into the output buffer.  This 
                is fine for devices which properly recognize the 
                backspace character.  Some printers, however, do not 
                recognize backspaces, so the option is provided to 
                overprint one line buffer with another.  The first 
                line buffer is terminated with just a carriage return 
                rather than the carriage return - linefeed 
                combination.  A zero argument or no argument to the 
                backspace command removes backspaces from the output.  
                A non-zero argument leaves them in the output.  The 
                default is to remove backspaces.  

                            ___                                                    .cc - changes the NRO command character to that specified by 
                the character argument.  If no argument is provided, 
                the default is a period.  

          .ce - causes the next line of text to appear centered on the 
                output.  The optional argument specifies if more than 
                one line is to be centered.  

          .de - causes all text and commands following to be used to 
                                                                    en                   define a macro.  The definition is terminated by a .en 
                command.  The first two characters of the argument 
                               de                                                      following the .de command become the name of the new 
                command.  It should be noted that upper and lower case 
                arguments are considered different.  Thus, the 
                          PP      pp                                              commands .PP and .pp could define two different 
                macros.  Care should be exercised since existing 
                commands may be redefined.  

                A macro may contain up to ten arguments.  In the macro 
                definition, the placement of arguments is designated 
                by the two character sequences, $0, $1, ... $9.  When 
                the macro is invoked, each argument of the macro 
                command line is substituted for its corresponding 
                designator in the expansion.  The first argument of 
                the macro command is substituted for the $0 in the 
                expansion, the second argument for the $1, and so 
                forth.  Arguments are typically strings which do not 
                contain blanks or tabs.  If an argument is to contain 
                blanks, then it should be surrounded by either single 
                or double quotes.  

          .cu - causes the next line(s) of text to be continuously 
                                                                ul                    underlined.  Unlike the underline command (see .ul) 
                which underlines only alphanumerics, continuous 
                underlining underlines all printable characters.  The 
                optional argument specifies the number of lines of 
                text to underlined.  Any normal underlining or 
                boldface commands currently in effect will be 
                terminated.

          .ef - specifies the text for the footer on even numbered 
                pages.  The format is the same as for the footer 
                              fo                      command (see .fo).  

          .eh - specifies the text for the header on even numbered 
                pages.  The format is the same as for the footer 
                              fo                      command (see .fo).  

          .en - designates the end of a macro definition.  

          .fi - causes the input text to be rearranged or filled to 
                obtain the maximum word count possible between the 
                previously set left and right margins.  No argument is 
                expected.  

          .fo - specifies text to be used for a footer.  The footer 
                text contains three strings seperated by a delimiter 
                character.  The first non-blank character following 
                the command is designated as the delimiter.  The first 
                text string is left justified to the current 
                                                 in                                 indentation value (specified by .in).  The second 
                string is centered between the current indentation 
                value and the current right margin value (specified by 
                 rm                                                                 .rm).  The third string is right justified to the 
                current right margin value.  The absence of footer 
                text will result in the footer being printed as one 
                blank line.  The presence of the page number character 
                         pc                                                              (set by .pc) in the footer text results in the current 
                page number being inserted at that position.  Multiple 
                occurrances of the page number character are allowed.  

          .he - specifies text to be used for a header.  The format is 
                                                 fo                      the same as for the footer (see .fo).  

          .in - indents the left margin to the column value specified 
                by the argument.  The default left margin is set to 
                zero.  

          .ju - causes blanks to be inserted between words in a line 
                of output in order to align or justify the right 
                margin.  The default is to justify.  

          .ls - sets the line spacing to the value specified by the 
                argument.  The default is for single spacing.  

          .m1 - specifies the number of lines in the header margin.  
                This is the space from the physical top of page to and 
                including the header text.  A value of zero causes the 
                header to not be printed.  A value of one causes the 
                header to appear at the physical top of page.  Larger 
                argument values cause the appropriate number of blank 
                lines to appear before the header is printed.  

          .m2 - specifies the number of blank lines to be printed 
                between the header line and the first line of the 
                processed text.  

          .m3 - specifies the number of blank lines to be printed

                between the last line of processed text and the footer 
                line.  

          .m4 - specifies the number of lines in the footer margin.  
                                                                  m1                   This command affects the footer the same way the .m1 
                command affects the header.  

          .ne - specifies a number of lines which should not be broken 
                across a page boundary.  If the number of lines 
                remaining on a page is less than the value needed, 
                then a new output page is started.  

          .nf - specifies that succeeding text should be printed 
                without rearrangement, or with no fill.  No argument 
                is expected.  

          .nj - specifies that no attempt should be made to align or 
                justify the right margin.  No argument is expected.  

          .nr - causes the value of a number register to be set or 
                modified.  A total of twenty-six number registers are 
                available designated @na through @nz (either upper or 
                lower case is allowed).  When the sequence @nc is 
                imbedded in the text, the current value of number 
                register c replaces the sequence, thus, such things as 
                paragraph numbering can be accomplished with relative 
                ease.  

          .of - specifies the text for the footer on odd numbered 
                pages.  The format is the same as the footer command 
                      fo                      (see .fo).  

          .oh - specifies the text for the header on odd numbered 
                pages.  The format is the same as the footer command 
                      fo                      (see .fo).  

          .pc - specifies the page number character to be used in 
                headers and footers.  The occurrance of this character 
                in the header or footer text results in the current 
                page number being printed.  The default for this 
                character is the hash mark (#).  

          .pl - specifies the page lenght or the number of lines per 
                output page.  The default is sixty-six.  

          .po - specifies a page offset value.  This allows the 
                formatted text to be shifted to the right by the 
                number of spaces specified.  This feature may also be 
                invoked by a switch on the command line.  

          .rm - sets the column value for the right margin.  The 
                default is eighty.  

          .so - causes input to be retrieved from the file specified 
                by the command's character string argument.  The 
                contents of the new file are inserted into the output 
                stream until an EOF is detected.  Processing of the 
                original file is then resumed.  Command nesting is

                allowed.  

          .sp - specifies a number of blank lines to be output before 
                printing the next line of text.  

          .ti - temporarily alters the indentation or left margin 
                value for a single succeeding line of text.  

          .ul - underlines the alphanumeric text in the following 
                line(s).  The optional argument specifies the number 
                of lines to be underlined.  Underlining and boldface 
                are mutually exclusive features.  The appearance of an 
                underline command cancels any existing boldface 
                operations.
