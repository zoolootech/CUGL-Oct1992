The correct order in which to read the documentation files is: 
QED122.DOC, QED11.DOC, QED.DOC, E.DOC.  The latter is not supplied 
on QED disks, but the QEDx.DOC files should be sufficient to use the 
editor.  E.DOC is available from CUG. QEDFUNCS.DOC is a list of 
functions by file and is valuable for modifying the editor.  
QEDPC.DOC is a short introduction to QED and most of the features are 
understandable without reading any of the above documentation files.
It is also useable for QE, the CP/M version.

QEWT.COM is a version of QE for the Televideo 925 terminal that 
has wordwrap, but not version maintenance.  QET.COM is for the 
same hardware, has version maintenance and no wordwrap.  These 
configurations were created to keep the COM file size down to 
permit a reasonable number of lines to be edited.  Both wordwrap 
and version updating are possible in the same COM file, but the 
number of lines that may be edited is too severely limited.

Please feel free to report any bugs or suggestions for future 
modifications to me at the address below.  More importantly, make 
your own modifications and report them, if significant, to CUG.
