			A REVIEW OF BC

     BC evaluates mathematical expressions entered at the
console, and prints the numerical values.  Expressions may
contain integers, arithmetic and logical operators, and
parentheses.  All results are integers ranging from 0 to 65535,
and are printed in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary
formats.

     BC offers to print instructions when it first starts.  If
you accept the offer, BC quickly prints more than can be dis-
played on most CRT terminals, so you need to be ready to use
the control-s key.  BC then prompts for the first expression.
While you are entering expressions, the usual CP/M line editing
functions work, so you can easily correct entry errors, or
start over.  When a carriage return is entered, BC evaluates
the expression, prints the result, and prompts for another
expression.  Expression evaluation seems instantaneous,
and appeared to be accurate in the few cases tested.

     Operator precedence is strictly left-to-right, which
produces unexpected results unless extra parentheses are used
to force BC to use the operators in the normal order.
The exclusive-OR logical operator (~) does not work; it
produces an error message.  Also, while the instructions
state that hexadecimal, octal, and binary numbers may be
entered, there are no instructions for entering such numbers,
and I was unable to hit upon the method.  All numbers I
entered were interpreted as decimal numbers.

     BC tolerates operator errors without falling apart, but is
not always helpful in identifying errors.  It tells you if you
have unbalanced parentheses, but doesn't always tell you if
you use an operator that it doesn't recognize.

     The documentation file, BC.DOC provides clear and correct
instructions for compiling, and lists the files needed.
