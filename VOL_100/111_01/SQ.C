/**********************************************************************

 * This program compresses a file without losing information.
 * The usq.com program is required to unsqueeze the file
 * before it can be used.
 *
 * Typical compression rates are:
 *	.COM	6%	(Don't bother)
 *	.ASM	33%	(using full ASCII set)
 *	.DIC	46%	(using only uppercase and a few others)
 * Squeezing a really big file takes a few minutes.
 *
 * Useage:
 *	SQ item ...
 * where ... represents more (optional) items and
 * "item" is either:
 *	drive:		to change the output drive
 *	file		input file
 *	drive:file	input file
 *	-		toggle debugging display mode
 *
 * If no such items are given on the command line you will be
 * prompted for commands (one at a time). An empty command
 * terminates the program.
 *
 * SQ uses the dio package, so input and output can be redirected
 * by special items on the command line such as:
 *	<file		reads console input from file
 *	>file		sends console output to file
 *	+file		sends console output to console and file
 * Also console output of another program using dio can be piped
 * to the input of this one or vice-versa. Example:
 *	A>fls parameters |sq
 * where fls might be a program that expands patterns like *.com
 * to a list of specific file names for sq to squeeze.
 *
 * The squeezed file name is formed by changing the second
 * letter of the file type to Q. If there is no file type,
 * the squeezed file type is QQQ. If the name exists it is
 * overwritten!
 *
 * Examples:
 *	A>SQ GRUMP		makes GRUMP.QQQ on A:
 *	A>SQ D:CRAP.XYZ		makes CRAP.XQZ on A:
 *	A>SQ B: D:CRAP.COM	makes CRAP.CQM on B:
 *	B>SQ X.A C: Y.B		makes X.AQ on B: and Y.BQ on C:
 *
 * The transformations compress strings of identical bytes and
 * then encode each resulting byte value and EOF as bit strings
 * having lengths in inverse proportion to their frequency of
 * occurrence in the intermediate input stream. The latter uses
 * the Huffman algorithm. Decoding information is included in
 * the squeezed file, so squeezing short files or files with
 * uniformly distributed byte values will actually increase size.

/* CHANGE HISTORY:
 * 1.3	Close files properly in case of error exit.
 * 1.4	Break up long introductory lines.
 * 1.4	Send introduction only to console.
 * 1.4	Send errors only to console.
 * 1.5  Fix BUG that caused a rare few squeezed files
 *	to be incorrect and fail the USQ crc check.
 *	The problem was that some 17 bit codes were
 *	generated but are not supported by other code.
 *	THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE affecting TR2.C and SQ.H and
 *	requires recompilation of all files which are part
 *	of SQ. Two basic changes were made: tree depth is now
 *	used as a tie breaker when weights are equal. This
 *	makes the tree shallower. Although that may always be
 *	sufficient, an error trap was added to cause rescaling
 *	of the counts if any code > 16 bits long is generated.
 * 1.5	Add debugging displays option '-'.
