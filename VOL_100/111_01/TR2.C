/******** Second translation - bytes to variable length bit strings *********/


/* This translation uses the Huffman algorithm to develop a
 * binary tree representing the decoding information for
 * a variable length bit string code for each input value.
 * Each string's length is in inverse proportion to its
 * frequency of appearance in the incoming data stream.
 * The encoding table is derived from the decoding table.
 *
 * The range of valid values into the Huffman algorithm are
 * the values of a byte stored in an integer plus the special
 * endfile value chosen to be an adjacent value. Overall, 0-SPEOF.
 *
 * The "node" array of structures contains the nodes of the
 * binary tree. The first NUMVALS nodes are the leaves of the
 * tree and represent the values of the data bytes being
 * encoded and the special endfile, SPEOF.
 * The remaining nodes become the internal nodes of the tree.
 *
 * In the original design it was believed that
 * a Huffman code would fit in the same number of
 * bits that will hold the sum of all the counts.
 * That was disproven by a user's file and was a rare but
 * infamous bug. This version attempts to choose among equally
 * weighted subtrees according to their maximum depths to avoid
 * unnecessarily long codes. In case that is not sufficient
 * to guarantee codes <= 16 bits long, we initially scale
 * the counts so the total fits in an unsigned integer, but
 * if codes longer than 16 bits are generated the counts are
 * rescaled to a lower ceiling and code generation is retried.
 */

/* Initialize the Huffman translation. This requires reading
 * the input file through any preceding translation functions
 * to get the frequency distribution of the various values.
