This program lets you view (look), edit and write back a sector
on a diskette. It needs a 24*80 cursor addressable terminal.
modify the CLRSCREEN() and GOTOXY() functions. I have not designed
it to work with those systems using the DEBLOCK routine in their 
BIOS's to handle physical sectors larger than 128 bytes, so
if you want to use it and have such a system you must modify
the routines which write back the edited sector in SE.
The BitMap command is not implemented. 

THIS PROGRAM NEEDS CP/M 2.x !!!!!!

I'm using v1.43 of BDS C compiler on a 60k CP/M 2.2.
SE uses 2.x functions which are not available on
CP/M 1.x so it will need patching for running under 1.x.

SE needs 24 * 80 cursor addressable terminal.  Functions
screen clearing and cursor addressing are at the beginning of SE.C.
SE's write command is not tested with BIOS using DEBLOCK
library routine (for physical sectors larger than 128 byte)

Cursor movement when editing:

                 Ctrl-E = UP
                 Ctrl-S = LEFT
                 Ctrl-D = RIGHT
                 Ctrl-X = DOWN
                 Ctrl-A = TO LEFT MARGIN
                 Ctrl-F = TO RIGHT MARGIN
                 Ctrl-Z = TO HOME POSITION
                 ESCAPE = END EDITING

Most commands, except BYe, can be abbreviated to one letter.

NewDisk/Bye           Uses no arguments

Drive                 Takes drive code (A-P) as argument

Edit/Look/Write       You must specify TRACK and SECTOR, ex.
                      LOOK SECTOR 2 TRACK 23 (abbrev. L S 2 T 23)
                      A special case is when you specify '-' or
                      '+' as only argument, Sector will be incremented
                      or decremented. Let's say that you after the
                      the command given above you want to look at the
                      next sector, then:
                      LOOK +   (abbreviated L +)
                 

The program will use the SECTRAN skewing BIOS entry for all tracks
except the system tracks.
