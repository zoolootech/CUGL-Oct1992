             This  is  the first of two files that are displayed  on  the 
        screen  via  the batch file HELP.BAT.     The installation  batch 
        file distributed with the Shell automatically boots the Shell  as 
        it last command.    The Shell is booted with menuing enabled, and 
        the first command is to run the Help batch file.

             This  Help batch file is designed to go on and  display  the 
        file SHELL.DOC which is a complete manual on the Shell.    If you 
        want to read through SHELL.DOC,  use the instructions displayed at 
        the top of the screen to page through the file.   Whenever you want 
        to stop it, just press ESC, and this will get you back to the Shell.
