        1/23/86 
             Be  sure and read the information on Menu Limitations in the 
        Manual.  Menus do not run on DOS versions below 3.xx.
             Ctrl-T  now deletes the command or phrase to the right,  not 
        the entire line to the right.
             Home will move to the beginning of the command - line.
             End will move to the last character on the command - line.
             !  will  display a history of the other 19 commands  in  the 
        buffers.
             !#  (where  #  is a number from 1 - 19) displays  the  given 
        command line buffer.
             Backspace and ^H now  perform backspace-delete.
             Del now deletes the character under the cursor (like ^G).

             A bug concerning the Date and Time commands has been fixed.
             
        2/25/86
             The  Shell  still uses about 44-48k of memory.    To  verify 
        this,  run the MEM command and note the available memory.    Then 
        run another image of the Shell while the current Shell is already 
        running.    Run the MEM command again and subtract the difference 
        in available memory.   Type EXIT to return to the first Shell.
             The  current version is only about 24K on disk (it was  32K) 
        before.    I  hope  to get memory usage down to  32K  eventually, 
        assuming I can squeeze some new features in at the same time.
             I have a number of features I will probably add.   I like to 
        take  the time to consider whether something is really worthwhile 
        before  adding it,  so do NOT consider this a promise that  these 
        will be added, or soon.   However, these may include:
                  * Improved alias capabilities.
                  * A sophisticated shell file interpreter.
                  * Use of the DOS environment strings and prompt.
                  * Argument expansion specification in CONFIG.SH.
                  * Shell configuration modify and show commands.
                  * Command Line Macros.
                  * Specification of the History length in CONFIG.SH.
                  * All sorts of other goodies!   If you have an idea,
                       share it with me!
