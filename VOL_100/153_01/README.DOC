  This floppy contains a set of utility routines, batch files, and
programs that I wrote while learning about the IBM-PC and the "C"
programming lanquage.  Since this was a learning experience for me I
will not guarantee that they are efficient or bug free though I have
tried very hard to make them that way.	I would be most interested in
any additions or improvements that anyone might make to these routines.

  Also note that these routines were written in the following environ-
ment:

		IBM-PC		256K		Monochrome screen
		Epson MX-100 parallel printer
		2 Serial ports
		2 DS/SD floppy disk drives

  Some of these routines have been ported to the IBM-PC aztec "C" under
Concurrent CP/M and to a VAX 11/780 under VMS with minimal modifications.
Obviously the DOS functions and 8088 assembler routines didn't port well
but the "C" code needed almost no changes.

notes about some of the files on this disk -

*.C and *.ASM files

This are utility subroutines written in MICROSOFT "C".  These
utilities include a menu system, cursor and screen control (using DOS
or direct to BIOS), julian and gregorian date/time routines, and "C"
callable assembler routines that issue BIOS interrupts.  NOTE - the
DOS cursor and screen control utilities require DEVICE=ANSI.SYS
command line be in the CONFIG.SYS file.  The BIOS cursor and screen
controls do not require this.


communications program (IBMTTY.C)

This program is a terminal emulation/communications program written in
MICROSOFT "C".  It is usable but not recommended for use becouse of
user unfriendlyness and a high error rate.  Its main reason for
inclusion is as an example of use of the various utility subroutines
in the \util subdirectory.  It also provides an example of direct
control of the IBM serial communications board.


Batch files (*.BAT)

These batch files emulate some of the most common UNIX commands on
the IBM-PC.  The compiler and linker batch files are set up for the
MICROSOFT "C" compiler and linker.  To use these batch files it is
recommended to set up a PATH command in AUTOEXEC.BAT to include this
subdirectory and the compiler subdirectory in the search path.
ex. (A> PATH a:\;a:\unix;a:\compiler).
