To whom it may concern:

     These files show how to revise the Software Toolworks' C/80 
floating point library (for 8080/Z80) so that it uses the AMD 
9511A (Intel 8231A) hardware math chip.  I planned to submit this 
disk to the CUG after my article appeared in Micro/Systems, but 
lo! the MCHIP80 disk (CUG vol.162) was released first.
     However, I don't think either MCHIP80 or my patch is 
redundant for two reasons.  First, my patch is easier to use.  
Unlike MCHIP80, which forbids initialization of floats and 
requires replacement of atof() and ftoa(), my patch doesn't 
require any program redesign--anything that is legal with the 
original floating point library is OK with my patch.  Second, 
MCHIP80 illustrates a generally applicable stratagem for 
modifying the performance of a high level language:  intercepting 
calls to library routines by cleverly sequencing the files 
submitted to a linking loader.
     Anyway, Walt Bilofsky suggested that I send these to you 
when I discussed it with him.

                                       Yours truly,
