Many public domain utilities exist which can execute the concatenation of
files (i.e. join them end to end).  The program zipp was written to join up
to seven ASCII files in a side to side or column sense.  This is useful in 
data analysis, spreadsheets, and reports.

The program is written in C.  The executable file is complied for an 8080 and
CP/M with Aztec C.  The command line is simply

		zipp file1 file2 [ ... file7] [>outfile]

where the output is to stdout and redirection to a file, prn:, or lst: can be 
specified.

I have taken the liberty of renaming these files from ZIP.*
to ZIPP.*, so there is no name conflict with the Ashton-Tate's
ZIP.COM -- their screen design program for dBASE II.
