                                 GED 2.00

I. Introduction ( goto Changes and Additions if you already use ged )

Ged, a.k.a. "go edit", is an adaptation of J.W.Haefner's MS-DOS QED text
editor to COMPAQ/IBM-PC hardware, making extensive use of DeSmet C's pcio
video routines.

Since this is only an adaptation I have left in all references to previous
authorship.  I have also retained most of Mr. Haefner's documentation -
as much of it still applies to Ged.

                                 Why GED?

Initially my goal was to produce an editor to replace what I've used for
almost two years, ( Turbo Pascal's editor ), and to one day port it to a
UNIX/XENIX environment.  At this point in time I feel I've made some good
progress towards that end and have decided to pass on the fruits of my
research.

I started this project back in January '86, and spent a good deal of     
time trying to make GED work using ansi.sys.  It eventually did run, but  
not much faster than what I can do in BBx, Business Basic.  Ansi.sys  
should be used sparingly.  Around Spring '86, I started over again, this
time playing with interrupts and feverishly re-reading my Norton's. It  
then dawned on me - "why re-invent the wheel", and I opted to use the  
video routines that were supplied with DeSmet C's compiler package.  

( My reluctance to using pcio was motivated by not wanting to learn assembly
language - there's no way around it.  At least with gedio.a you've got some
good working examples. )



II. Changes and Additions

Function Key Definitions:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
F1  = help menu
F2  = update time
F3  = move cursor left one word       to change
F4  = move cursor right one word          ""
F5  = save the current file and resume editing
F6  = execute ls                see getenv()
F7  = execute more                ditto
F8  = execute grep                ditto
F9  = turn on graphics editor - display IBM extended ASCII tables
F10 = reset run-time variables and options.


Cursor Control Keys:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Home      = cursor to left edge of screen
End       = cursor to end of line
PgUp      = move cursor up to beginning of file
              text scrolls down
PgDn      = move cursor down to end of file
              text scrolls up

Arrows    = as expected
Alt       = if IBM chars table on - then get character from 10-key pad.
GreyMinus = move cursor word left
GreyPlus  = move cursor word right


Version:
컴컴컴컴
v2.00   Converting Ged to MicroSoft 5.0 and Qic C.
        Added Gedio.asm, ged low level screen routines which compile
        under MASM.

v1.15   Added IBM extended graphics chars( box parts, etc. ).
        Added grey-minus and grey-plus key detection.

v1.11   Added getenv() - DeSmet 3.0 specific.
        Cleaned up screen I/O, it all begins with scr_, except for putstr.

        All scr_ functions are located in gedio.a
        All scr_ co-ordinates are set for ( col, row ).
        All interrupt coded functions are in ged11.c.

        Added overtype mode and capslock indicator.
        Speeded up cursor movement.
        Some additional fixes as suggested by Andrew Binstock.

v1.10   Annoying delete to end of line problem cleaned up.
        Delete routine did not have actual cursor location.
        Only showed up if deleting at postion greater than
        screen width.

        Changed inject function to writ_txb - easier to relate to.
        Cleaned up putline and rewrite functions.
        Added execute function to run other people's programs.

        Added J.W.Haefner's reform routine.  This is for letter
        writing and not programming.  Reset right margin using F10.
        ( Routine still needs some work )

v1.05   Added printer error recovery routine.  Printer routine covers
        trying to write to non-existent printer, meaning - you forgot
        to plug it in.  Further success of routine appears to be somewhat
        printer dependent.  You plugged the printer in then turned it off.

        Added undo routine from N. Gilbert's 'e' 4.8 CP/M editor.
      ( Undo replays the last 100 line changes, including deletes,
        moves, etc.  It's very handy. )


New Functions:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

1. undo()     Undo will undo the last change(s) - up to one hundred.
              To use, enter ^_.

2. reform()   Use to reformat blocks of text.
              Current Default is 72 characters.  To change, use F10 Key to
              call file Context Menu.  To use, place cursor at beginning of
              text block and enter ^QR.  Will work with undo.  You must
              move the cursor off the line before reforming.

3. execute()  Must use elink.bat and elink.dat.  See function key assignments
              in ged.c, and execute() and show_fkeys() in ged1.c.  Execute
              will clean up after itself depending on how the last argument
              is set.

4. getenv()   It is now possible to locate ls.exe and more.exe using environ-
              mental variables which you can set in your autoexec.bat file.

              SET LS=c:\exe\ls.exe
              SET MORE=c:\exe\more.exe
              SET GREP=c:\exe\grep.exe

            ( I store my more useful executables in a subdirectory named \exe.
              You must set LS, or whatever you call it, in the function key
              assignment section of ged.c as well.  See ged.c for examples. )

              Make sure to set ansi.sys in your config.sys file as ls and
              more use the reverse display drivers.

Books:
컴컴컴
   I recommend the following books for the serious enthusiast:

  "Crafting 'C' Tools for the IBM PCs", Joe Campbell, Prentice-Hall.

  "Advanced MS-DOS", Ray Duncan, MicroSoft Press.


Bugs:
컴컴
  As of GED 1.10 I became aware of a potentially troublesome bug.
  Make sure that readall in ged.c is always set to YES - else you may end
  up zapping some random disk sectors. ( Especially if attempting to save
  a file before completely reading it in. )

  There's a bug in displaying tabs properly - I wish someone would fix
  it.  I don't use tabs.

  Printer error routines could work better.


Other:

  Also, please report anything you feel is a bug or that needs improvement.
  Fixes and constructive criticism are welcomed.

 What won't work.  The following Ascii characters will cause you problems.   
                                                                             
 009 or '\t'.  I don't use tabs, but for those those who do, '\t' makes for  
               some funny looking displays if not converted to blanks.       
                                                                             
 010 or '\n'.  Will do as expected.  Ged is still a text editor.             
                                                                             
 026 or ^Z.    Stops your read dead in it's tracks.                          
                                                                             
 Of the three, only ^Z is useful as graphics character - Paul Mace may argue 
 otherwise.  If you really need to use these forbidden characters it's best  
 to write them rather than store them.                                       
                                                                             
 What will work.  F9 turns on the extended graphics mode and puts up the     
 first table.  Alt + the number of the char entered with the 10-key pad will 
 write the character at the cursor location.  Control L, ^L, will repeat it  
 till it is changed or you do a search/replace function.                     
                                                                             
 There's nothing magic here - it's just a fact of life for P.C. users.

III.1  DOCUMENTATION FOR QE AND QED/GED   (J.W.Haefner - 7 August 1985)

This is documentation for the programs QE and QED:  two modifications of 
'e' version 4.6b.  QE is the modification for BDS-C and QED is the 
modification for DeSmet-C (hence the "D") under MSDOS version 2.x.  Since 
the basic structure of these modifications is still that of e, that 
documentation is relevant and I indicate here only the differences.

     'e' is a fine program, carefully written with good logical structure; 
however, editors are a personal matter and many features that I thought 
desirable were either missing, or awkwardly implemented.  Consequently, QE 
and QED is the result of an attempt to incorporate different and additional 
functions.  Most of these derive from WordStar, my favorite word 
processor.  Since the modifications are basically superficial and (at one 
level) "cosmetic", I have retained all references to Nigel Gilbert as the 
author and copyright holder.  Each file indicates that it is a modification 
of the original e (ver. 4.6).  On the other hand, my modifications conflict 
to some degree with the philosophy detailed in the documentation to the 
original 'e'.  Therefore, as indication of this possible conflict, I have 
given new names to these modifications.  The "Q" was originally to mean 
"quick", as my initial goal was to produce a smaller, faster version of 'e', 
as I thought it terribly long and slow.  I did not achieve this goal and 
instead came away with the perception that virtural memory editors must be 
this large and slow.  Mr. Gilbert has done an admirable job.


I.   QE and QED

  A.   WordStar functions

     1.   SCROLLING:  ^W scrolls the screen down (i.e. UP through the text) 
and leaves the cursor on the line and column prior to scroll.  ^Z scrolls
the screen up in the same manner.

     2.   Delete to End of Line: ^QY deletes all text from the cursor to the 
end of the line.

     3.   Delete Line: ^\ now deletes the current line (this makes it 
difficult to err, identical to my version of WordStar).  In 'e' v 4.6 and QE 
and QED lines deleted can be recovered if the cursor has not left its 
vertical sceen postion by typing ^N^_ (i.e. insert new empty line (^N), and 
recover (^_)).  A more elaborate UNDO function is implemented in 'e' ver 
4.8, but I don't feel a need for it.

     4. Block manipulation: all of these are done through ^K as in WordStar.
These functions are: quit (Q, as in 'e'), save and exit (X, as in WordStar),
file read (R), repeat a jump to the last jump line (J), and the block moves of
'e' (B).

     5.   Exit with Save: ^KX saves the file being edited and exits directly 
to the operating system.

     6.   BACKSPACE == LEFTKEY in all applications except find/replace 
editing.

     7.   QUICK functions;  analogous to WordStar, ^Q switches to other 
functions (i.e. environment (K), delete to end of line (Y), find (F), alter 
(A).

     8.   Top and Bottom o Screen:  ^Y moves cursor to top of screen, ^V
moves to bottom of screen.

     9. KEYS: wherever possible, I have used WordStar mnemonics for
control characters.  This is almost exact for the left hand; the right hand
uses my own choices (e.g. move to left end of line = ^O, to right end of 
line = ^P, etc.   These are documented with a revised HELP display obtained 
via ^^ (difficult to type but the interface is so obvious that I rarely, if 
ever,  use HELP).  Below I give a map of the keys used in QE and QED.

     10. READ ALL ON INITIAL LOAD: As a matter of preference, the initial
reading of a file from disk reads the entire file or as much as possible to
fill memory before displaying the first page.  Alteration of this feature 
currently requires re-compilation, but it could easily be implemented as a 
command line option. 

   B.   Fixes to "bugs"

     2.   JUMP:  Use of "-Jn" on the command line where n is an integer
causes the initial program load to jump to line number n, or the bottom of 
the file if n is greater than the number of lines in the file.  This is 
similar to 'e' ver 4.8. I have further modified the jump command to permit 
relative (+/-) jumps of any length (unlike page up or down; alas, not as 
useful as I had hoped).  Moreover, use of "^J,<CR>" or "^J,ESC" sets the 
"jumpto" variable to the current line.  Use of ^KJ repeats the last jump.  
Thus, a very simple "jump marker" is implemented as the following example 
illustrates:

               ^J,<CR> (mark this line),
               ...some editing...,
               ^U (top of file),
               ... more editing,
               ^KJ (back to line number marked earlier).

I find this feature very useful.  If editing following jump line marking 
adds or deletes lines, then ^KJ will not return to the identical text 
orginally marked (since that text now has a different line number).  This 
could be fixed in later versions.  More than one "jump marker" would be 
desirable.

     3.   REPEAT PAGING: In repeated use of page up or page down, 'e' ver 
4.6 causes all pages to be completely rewritten.  To speed up movement 
through a file, I allow the rewriting of a page to be interrupted if the 
next comand in the buffer is either "pageup" or "pagedown".  On the files 
QE2A and QE3A for terminals such as ADDS Viewpoint that do not have line 
insert functions, scrolling down (^W) requires re-writing the entire page, 
this is also enhanced by looking at the type-ahead buffer to interupt page 
re-writing if the next character is also for "scroll down".

     4.   CONTROL CHARACTERS:  Use of the sequence "ESC,char" to embed control 
characters into the text did not work properly on my 'e' ver. 4.6.  This has 
been fixed.

     5.   PRINTING CONTROL CHARACTERS:  'e' transmits only a few (none?) 
control characters to the printer.  QE and QED send most control characters 
so that dot matrix printers can be manipulated within the editor (e.g. set 
margins, condensed print, etc).

     6.   FAST DISPLAY 1:   Most screen I/O replaced with direct video
writes.

     7.   FAST DISPLAY 2:  I allow characters to be inserted into the type-
ahead buffer only after a line has been written except when inserting text.  
'e'  ver 4.6 checks for more input to buffer after every character is 
written.  This slows down the display.  Checking at the end of each line 
seems to cause no problems.  Moreover, 'e' ver 4.6 does not check for type-
ahead buffer overflow; this is a problem on fast terminals with repeat keys. 
Text insertion is checked after each character inserted so that fast typists 
do not lose characters.

     8.   HIGH-LIGHT CURRENT LINE:  The use of all text displayed in normal 
attributes or dimmed with current line normal as in verson 4.6 is controlled 
by a conditional compile statement.  'e' ver 4.8 uses an internal global 
variable permitting switching within sessions.  Since I never want that 
feature and since the fewer "if-checks" the better, I opted for the re-
compilation solution.

     9.   FIND/ALTER STRINGS:  'e' ver 4.6 allowed most control characters 
to be embedded in the string to find or alter, but escape (0x1b) was used to 
terminate the string and thus could not be searched for.  I implemented a 
kludge to work around this.  ^] is translated to 0x1b and embedded in the 
string.  A reminder of this is presented when the find/alter function is 
selected.  Also several other control characters can now be embedded that 
could not have been in 'e'.  Other changes to this function allow the 
"retrieve" function to replay the last previous string to find and alter 
from the current positon of the cursor in the string to the end.  Thus, if 
the previous search string is non-empty, then the retrieve function prints 
the previous string from the current position to the end.  If the previous 
search string is empty or the cursor is at the end of the non-empty previous 
search string, then use of the retrieve function will embed the key code for 
the retrieve function into the search string.  For the file of terminal 
characteristics currently used, this is ^L, which is also form feed.  The 
current implementation allows primitive editing of the search string without 
re-typing the entire line.  Assume the previous search string is non-empty; 
the retrieve function (^L) will display to end; backspace and replace 
character to be edited; ^L will re-display the remainder of the string.  To 
re-initialize a search string to be empty, simply backspace to the 
beginnning and hit ESC or <cr>.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     2.   HINTS TO FUTURE MODIFICATIONS:  For others that wish to modify
the program for their own purposes:  (1)  The file "GEDFUNCS.DOC" lists
the functions used in GED. (2)  Debugging messages can be displayed within
the editor by using the statements:

/* debug */
gotoxy(0,24);  printf("var1 = %d  var2 = %d ", var1, var2 );

If numeric output is required, the function  uspr" in GED3.c can be used.

                                                              mt - 10/05/86

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III.2  QED SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS

     QE has been tranlated to DeSmet-C under MSDOS 2.x  and called QED.  
Because of difference in the compiler and the operating system, several 
additional changes have been made.
 
     1.   MSDOS Ver 2.0:   QED requires generic MSDOS version 2.0 or higher 
and checks with a BDOS call that the system uses this version.  No IBM-PC etc 
specific BIOS calls are used.  I.e. no software interrupts below 20 hex are 
used, nor are any port or memory specific references made.

     2.   DIRECTORY:   QED function replaced with exec to ls.

     3.   NO BDOS ERROR RECOVERY:  I don't know how to trap BDOS errors in 
MSDOS, therefore Mr. Gilbert's elegant CP/M BDOS traps have been eliminated.  
I would, of course, be interested in knowing how to do this.

     4.   PATHS:    Specification of paths is supported for files.  A 
function to display and alter the path is implemented (via the file context 
function:  ^QKF).  Since full path names can be almost arbitrarily long, the 
status line will display the last 32 chars of the file name.

     5.   MODIFICATION CHECK: If the user attempts to discard a modified 
file without saving it, a query is presented to ensure this was intentional.

     6.   DEFAULT EXTENSION:  The extension of the file called on the 
command line is saved in a default file extension string.  Future file 
requests (performed within a given QED session) do not require a file 
extension to be given.  If no extension is given, the directory is first 
searched for a file as typed.  If this fails, the default extension is 
appended to the input file name and the search repeated.  The default 
extension is overridden by using an explicit extension.  The desirable 
modification of not having to give the file extenson on the command line is 
not necessary in MSDOS by using batch files to invoke QED.  For example, if 
a series of editing sessions is to be undertaken using assembly language 
programming, then the following .BAT file is useful:

               QED %1.ASM -T8 -J%2

If this batch file is called, say, "e" then the command line "e myprog 150" 
will invoke QED to load MYPROG.ASM, set the tabs to 8 spaces, and jump to 
line 150.  This could also be done with CP/M, but SUBMIT is slower than 
typing in the entire command line.

     7.   DeSmet SPECIFIC MODIFICATONS:  The DeSmet compiler is adequate and 
a good buy.  Several changes were made from QE (using BDS-C) to accomodate 
the different compiler and operating system.  (a)  The function "uspr" was 
altered to take 2 arguments to print either a short or long integer.  Long 
integers are necessary to display disk space on my 8" disks.  (b) The 
following functions were renamed to avoid collision with functions loaded by 
the DeSmet BINDer: "putc" to "eputc", "getc" to "egetc", "puts" to "eputs".  
This renaming might not be necessary, but the manual suggests it is.
