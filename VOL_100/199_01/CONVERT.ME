This code will currently compile without error ( /W3 ) using MicroSoft
Qic C 1.0.

However, there are some problems with it.

ged9.c

/* initialise virtual memory system
 */
void initvm()
{
int  slot;

unsigned  int mem, stk;
unsigned  char  *base, *pagemem, *stkaddr;

#ifdef  MSC
  mem = _memavl();
  stk = stackavail();
  slotsinmem = ( mem - stk )/PAGESIZE;
  pagemem = (char *)( 65535 - mem );
#else
  freeall( 5000 );
  stkaddr = _showsp();
  pagemem = _memory();
  slotsinmem = ( stkaddr-STKSPACE-pagemem )/PAGESIZE;
#endif

This is the first place to start.  Obviously this won't work - but
it does allow you to at least get something on the screen.

The problem is to somehow come up with a suitable replacement that will work
for both MSC and DeSmet.  (DeSmet is faster and I think easier to use than MSC,
so it might be worth the effort to try and make Ged as portable as possible.)

This code initializes Ged's file and memory management system.

If you make any progress on getting ged to work using MSC would appreciate
hearing about it.

See ged.doc for more information.

Have included the latest version of ged.exe compiled using DeSmet 3.03.
