FV.C - LISTING #5

As I mentioned earlier,  this is my replacement for the CP/M dump 
utility.  It  allows  the user to pass one or two  files  in  the 
runstring  for  display.  If  one  file name  is  passed  in  the 
runstring,  the output appears much like the CP/M dump.com output 
with  the  addition of the ascii display.  If two file names  are 
passed,  the output consists of a line from file one, a line from 
file  two and a third line containing the exclusive oring of  the 
two files (labeled "dif"). In all cases, non printable characters 
are  replaced with a carrot ( ^ ) in the ascii portion and  nulls 
are  replaced  with an  equal sign ( =  ),  to  readily  identify 
comparisons between two files. The comparative output is purely a 
byte  for  byte operation and no attempt is made to  realign  the 
file  to comparing characters as in a compare utility.  The first 
file length controls display length.  Figures 1 shows an  example 
of  screen output from the runstring <fv cypher1.c>  and Figure 2 
from the runstring <fv cypher1.c cypher2.c>


FSTAT.C - LISTING #6

Descriptive  statistics is the name of the game here and as  with 
any statistical evaluation, one must be brutally honest (at least 
with oneself) to draw an objective conclusion. The entire file is 
read,  16Kbytes at a time. As we read, the occurrences of each of 
the 256 tokens is accumulated and we obtain the sum of all  bytes 
as well as the min and max token occurrences.  The sum is divided 
by  the total characters to obtain the mean,  the max becomes the 
mode  and the range is the difference between min and  max.  Next 
the  256  byte array is copied to a second array  and  sorted  to 
obtain the median.

With   all  calculations  completed,   the  numerical  values  of 
occurrences  are displayed in a 16 X 16 display  for  evaluation. 
The  statistical  characteristics are displayed and  the  program 
pauses  to  await some keyboard entry to display  the  histogram. 
Depressing  the space bar prints a scaled horizontal histogram of 
16 groups (0-15, 16-31, . . ., 241-256).

The ideal random file (which is what we'd like to see) would have 
the following characteristics:

     mean      127.5
     mode      not critical
     range     < 20% of the total bytes divided by 256
     median    at midpoint of range

     histogram reasonably flat

Remember I said ideal !  This is where judgement and self honesty 
come  into  play.  A  sequential file will  display  these  ideal 
characteristics as well as a true random file.  Also,  files that 
look  too  good statistically should be just as suspect as  those 
that don't. Figure 3 is the output produced by this article as is 
and Figure 4 when its encrypted with the runstring

    cypher crypt-tb.art new frederick -1 angelo -2 scacchitti -3

In   all  fairness, I  must  state  that  other  possibly  better 
statistical  methods  are better for  determining  randomness.  I 
opted  to use descriptive statistic because they are more  easily 
understood and implemented.


MAKEF.C - LISTING #7

A simple enough utility but an absolutely necessity if we are  to 
evaluate  encryption schemes.  A filename of n 256 byte blocks is 
created and if a value between 0 and 255 is passed the file  will 
be  filled  with  this value.  If no value (or one that  is  non-
numeric) is passed, each block contains a sequential count from 0 
to 255.  An added benefit to this program is its ability to clean 
a disk.  The user simply creates a file the size of the remaining 
disk  space  and then erases it.  This results in all  free  disk 
space being set as the user defined.


SP.C - LISTING #8

Along  with the fstat utility this one confirms or  denys  (maybe 
even  questions) the statistical data we received.  A brute force 
search  method is used to find matching character strings in  the 
file.  By default,  the search starts at the first character  and 
searches the first 128 bytes for a match of 4 or more characters. 
If  the  match depth exceeds the block size it is  searching  the 
program  will return to CP/M after displaying the match data.  If 
not it will continue in its search. Block size to search, minimum 
depth  of  comparison  and  starting  point  in  the  buffer  may 
optionally be changed in the runstring. 

Also  if  an  additional argument is passed ( one more  than  the 
three mentioned) the software converts the data in the buffer  to 
delta-form.  That is,  element[n] = element[n] - element[n+1] for 
all data in the buffer.  After the conversion is made the  search 
scheme  continues as before.  This feature allows us to  evaluate 
the file for some mathematical sequence.

One drawback to this program as it stands is the limiting  factor 
of the buffer size.  No attempt is made to search beyond it. This 
shouldn't matter for most text files.


SMALL C, CP/M, AND MISCELLANEOUS

chkkbd() is a function which enables us to stop display (program) 
activity  if Control-S is depressed.  Following with a  Control-C 
causes  a  return to CP/M and any other character will allow  the 
program to continue. This function calls a bdos() function so the 
user  may have to modify this for other  operating  systems.  The 
getchx()  function  is a non-echoing version of  getchar()  which 
uses BDOS function 6. getchar() may be substituted for getchx().

calloc(), malloc() and cfree() functions are used for the dynamic 
allocation and deallocation of memory. My allocation/deallocation 
scheme  is  of the simple variety where the programmer  must  pay 
heed to order or pay the consequences.  The source code contained 
here should work with most implementations of these functions.

Printer  output may be obtained from any of the programs by using 
the  CP/M  Control  P function.  It was the  simplest  method  to 
implement.

Math  functions  (especially  floating point) are  difficult  for 
Small-C.  There  are several routines in the fstat.c source  that 
perform the necessary long and fractional calculations.  It's not 
necessary  to  change these however,  if your  compiler  supports 
floats and longs, have at it.

Each program will display the usage if entered without the proper 
number of arguments in the run string.  Also, since most software 
users  begin  to feel uncomfortable when their  computer  is  off 
somewhere  performing exotic calculations,  each program displays 
status to the screen thus putting these fears at rest.  


CYPHER BENCHMARKS

My version, written in Small C, is generic enough to adapt to any 
C  compiler.  Running   on  a  4 Mhz Z80 based  CP/M  system,  it 
benchmarks  at less than 1K/sec for file I/O,  16K/sec  for  file 
transposition  and  approximately 4K/sec per key for  encryption. 
Key  encryption is difficult to benchmark since it  includes  the 
time  to generate the prime length key which varies from 1009  to 
1999 characters in length.


AND FINALLY

These tools should be employed with a measure of common sense.  A 
strong  cypher  is  only indicated when  both  statistically  and 
pattern-whise  indicated.  (And it doesn't hurt to view the  file 
either) My intent in developing these utilities was to enable the 
cryptographer-programmer  a means to evaluate the strength of  an  
encryption  scheme  as  well as the  resistance  of   schemes  to 
"cracking".  However  (like  most  tools) these can be  used  for UP - Version  %s\n", VERSION);
