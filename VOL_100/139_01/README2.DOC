          KED.C           The source code and header for the editor are
          KED2.C          in these three files.
          KED.H

          KAREL.H         The source code for the simulator.

          KAREL1.C        The source code for the world-builder.


          To create KED.COM, the executable version of the editor using a
          BDS C compiler:

          CC KED.C        Compile part 1 of the source code.
          CC KED2.C       Compile part 2 of the source code.
          KED.H is used as a header in both files and must be located on
          the same disk as the compiler.
          CLINK KED KED2  Link the compiled versions.

          Of course, compiling only needs to be done on files that have been
          modified but linking needs to be done if either or both have been
          modified.  Also, if this disk is in drive B, the file names will
          be B:KED.C AND B:KED2.C.

          To create the executable version of the world-builder:

          CC KAREL1.C     Compile the source code.
          CLINK KAREL1    Link the compiled version.

          KAREL.H is used as a header in the C translation of the syntax tree.
          It contains functions for KAREL's primitive instructions.

          The new versions of KED.COM, the executable version of the editor
          and KAREL1.COM, the executable version of the world-builder, and
          KAREL.H need to be copied to the user's disk after any changes.

          The Kaypro II video section was designed to imitate the control
          sequences of a Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal.  The escape sequence
          ESC= row + 32 positions the cursor at a given column (row).  The
          cursor controls are found in the listing of global constants for
          KAREL1.C and should be modified for other terminals.  The world
          array presumes an 80 X 24 display and would also need to be
          modified for other terminals.
