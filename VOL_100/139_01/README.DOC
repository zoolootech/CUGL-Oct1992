          I.  These are used to run the editor, world-builder and simulator:

                  KED.COM
                  KAREL.SUB
                  KAREL1.COM
                  KAREL.H

          II.   These are included for documentation:

                  UGUIDE.DOC   (user's guides for the editor and submit file)
                  SESSIONS.DOC (the three sample editing sessions referred
                                to in the user's guide)
                  MENU.DOC     (summary of the editor commands)
                  README.DOC   (this explanation)

          You must add the following from your BDS C and CP/M FILES:

                  BDSCIO.H
                  C.CCC
                  CC.COM
                  CC2.COM
                  CLINK.COM
                  BDS.LIB
                  DEFF.CRL
                  DEFF2.CRL
                  SUBMIT.COM

          I have formatted all the files in II, so copies can be run off on
          your printer.  Please let me know if you modify the
          documentation.  I'm interested in making it as easy to understand
          as possible.

          Also, please inform me of any bugs or any suggestions for
          refinement.  I hope to have a version that uses an S-BASIC
          translation instead of C by the end of summer '84.
