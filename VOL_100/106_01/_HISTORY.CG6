CREDITS -- Functions II

This disk is mostly a condensation of disks submitted by Harvey Moran,
M. J. Maney and Donald Stevens. I believe that most, if not all, of 
these functions were written under versions 1.31 and 1.32 of the BDS
compiler. Such being the case, some may be superceeded by the current
version's capacities (particularly changes in the standard library),
some may need modification before they will run correctly under 1.4x. 

If you find such instances and FIX them, please check with me, as I 
would prefer to distribute current versions if possible. Check before
you ship a disk. Someone else may have beaten you to it.

Maney reserves all commercial rights to his work, namely the CRL macro
package, CHARFUN, IOFUN, MACHINE, the STDIO package, and STRFUN. 

STevens submitted GRAVT100 (and a more general version which has 
apparently been lost), NOTI, OTOI, STDEF, UTIL1, SYSTEM, STRINGS.

Moran submitted the BIOSLB package, BSPAT1-4, DEFFMODS, the MOUSE
package, his modified STDLIB's and the XTRINS package. 

The BSPAT1 file documents how to make CP/M 1.4 do a true backspace
for the console. Moran hasn't supplied the whole (copyrighted) bios,
but has shown what to change. He warns "This is effective only if the
BDOS line buffered input routine is called and therefore does not
interfere with those who do not call it (practically every interactive
program in the world)."

The BIOSLB function allows access to the BIOS routines from within C. 
It was written before 1.4x and is superceded.

Queue was written and copywronged by Scott Layson.

PRVLIB is believed to be the work of M. Goldberg.
