/*				stdio.lib

	Copyright (C) 1980, M J Maney

	First created	3/15/80
	Last revised	3/15/80

	This library provides the defines and data declarations for the
	stdio functions, which are an attempt to simulate some of the
	things that a really nice OS (like UNIX) gives you in a less nice
	enviornment (BDS C running under CP/M).

	To work properly, this file MUST be included into the source of
	any program that wants to use the stdio functions, and the
	library file csym.lib must also be included. These two files
	MUST be the first two files included, and they MUST be included
	in the sequence

	#include "csym.lib"
	#include "stdio.lib"

	BEFORE any inline declarations of external (global) variables,
	and that includes any such declarations in any other file which
	is included! To be safe, just make the above two lines the first
	non-comment lines of the source. NB that they must be included
	in ALL source files for the program that declare globals!!
