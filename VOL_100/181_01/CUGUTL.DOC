The CUGINS program allows users to insert a HEADER TEMPLATE in a
series of files. A common example is program made up of many source
modules (i.e. YACC has 53 Source Modules and 2 Document Modules),
the CUG headers on these types of files are identical except
for the Filename entry.

To use this program the user must provide a HEADER TEMPLATE and a
list of the files to be processed.

The following is a example of such a Template:


/*
  HEADER: CUG    nnn.nn;
  TITLE:         YACC - Yet Another Compilier-Compilier
  VERSION:       1.0 for IBM-PC

Notice that the Filename entry is blank. This entry is automatically
filled in by the CUGINS Program. The Replacement Offset Parameter is
used to insure that the replacement text will be insert in the correct
place. In the case of example Template, the offset would be 6. This
would insure that the replacement text lined up with the other data.

The list of files to be processed can be generated by any editor. The
general practice for a large number of files is to cause the DIR
command to write a directory to disk and then use an editor to clean
up the file for use by CUGINS. The file names must be listed one
per line and can be any legal file expression recognized by DOS.

To generate a directory on disk:

                 B> DIR >DIR.DAT

The resulting disk file would look something like the following:

 Volume in drive B has no label
 Directory of  B:\

CUGINS   PAS     7132   1-08-84   6:09p
HEADER   DAT      642   1-08-84   5:12p
REST     BAT       89   1-07-84   8:41p
CUGINS   COM    14256   1-08-84   6:09p
LIST     DAT       19   1-08-84   6:11p
Y1IMP    C        712   1-08-84   6:14p
Y2IMP    C        712   1-08-84   6:14p
TURBOF3  MAC      319   1-08-84   7:42p
Y1IMP    CAK       57   1-08-84   6:00p
Y2IMP    CAK       57   1-08-84   6:00p
CUGINS   BAK     1131   1-08-84   7:56p
CUGINS   DOC     1893   1-08-84   8:05p
DIR      DAT        0   1-08-84   8:05p
       13 File(s)    320512 bytes free

After cleaning the file up we could be left with:

Y1IMP.C
Y2IMP.C
Y3IMP.C


                     ===============================

Now that the two data files we need have been created, the program
is executed as follows:

B> CUGINS list.dat header.dat 6

The file "list.dat" contains the list of files to be processed.
The file "header.dat" contains the HEADER TEMPLATE Data.
The third parameter, "Replacement Offset", is optional. If missing
it has the value of ONE(1).

If the "list.dat" or "header.dat" are not present, the user will
be requested to enter the correct file name.

Once the file list, "list.dat", and the HEADER TEMPLATE, "header.dat",
have been successfully loaded, the program will begin processing the
files in "list.dat". As each file is processed it's file specification
will be printed on the users terminal.

With the list specified above, the following would appear on the
users terminal:

B> CUGINS list.dat header.dat 6
Y1IMP.C
Y2IMP.C
Y3IMP.C

If the user enters CUGINS without the correct number of parameters
(2 or 3), the program will simply print out a brief usage description,
distribution rights and my copyright notice.


                          C U G E D T


This program, CUGEDT, will allow a user to edit an entries in the CUG
Headers on a whole series modules.

It works almost the same as CUGINS described above, with the following
glaring differences.

    1) The program name is CUGEDT,  NOT CUGINS!   (Rather Obvious)
    2) The HEADER TEMPLATE File is now called an EDIT File.
    3) The first two lines of the EDIT File specify the starting
       element of the area in the CUG file to be deleted (first line)
       and the element following the deleted area. (ie. The ending
       element is not deleted!)
    4) Line 3 through the last line comprise the text that will be
       inserted in place of the deleted text.


When this program is run, all files in the input file list will be
processed as follows:

    1) If the Starting Text key (Line one in the EDIT File) is found
       in the text file, all text including the start line will be
       deleted up to, but not including, the termination line (line
       two in the EDIT File).
    2) The replacement text (Lines 3 through "n") will be inserted
       in the text file IN FRONT OF THE TERMINATION LINE.


For example, if the CUG Header looks the same as the one shown above,
then the following EDIT File would replace the compilier information
element.

                             EDIT File

After running CUGEDT (i.e.  CUGEDT FILE.LST EDIT.FIL<CR> ) the header
shown above would look as follows:
