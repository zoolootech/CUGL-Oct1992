This is the latest version of the file compressor/decompressor pair,lzwcom 
and lzwunc.

They have been developed using the AZTEC C86 compiler, and are portable to 
any other standard C environment.  I have tested this code with AZTEC CII 
for the 8080, and with the C compiler on XENIX 286, and they work fine.


FILES:

lzwcom.c	- compressor main program
lzwunc.c	- uncompressor program
commlzw.c	- common routines
debug.h		- my homebrew debug header.  Defines the macro DEBUGGER, which
			  is sprinkled liberally throughout the other three files
lzwcom.exe	- the compressor program. runs on any MS-DOS machine.
lzwunc.exe  - the uncompressor program.

Questions or comments - leave on the Computer Language BBS 1 415 957 9370
or call Kent Williams direct (voice) at (319) 369-3131.

NOTE:  

This version fixes two potentially serious bugs -
1. The unknown codes were being decoded incorrectly, resulting usually 
in occasional swapped byte pairs.  This could play havoc with object files.

2. The output code buffer was not getting properly flushed - the last byte or
bytes ended up dropped from the uncompressed file.

If anyone is interested I can upload the latest code for CPM/80.
