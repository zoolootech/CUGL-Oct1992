        title     _kbdfly - C replacement for BASIC's INKEY$
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------;
;  This program gives C a replacement for BASIC's INKEY$ statement.
;  It's needed is because the extended keyboard characters
;  such as PgUp, Home, etc. return 'unusual' information from the DOS 
;  interrupt.  If the first character returned from certain DOS functions is
;  a zero and the zero flag indicates that it is a valid character, then
;  this means that a second interrupt needs to be performed to retrieve the
;  extended code.  Then the extended code must be communicated back to the
;  caller separately from a normal code because the decimal value of some
;  extended codes matches that of normal letters, e.g. Home key returns a
;  decimal 71, which is also the capital G.  The Home key returns the
;  value on the second interrupt, where the G comes on the first.  This
;  is similar to having to test the length of INKEY$'s returned string in
;
;  Also like INKEY$, if no character is present from the keyboard, control
;  returns anyway and a zero is present as the returned value.
;
;  Sample invocation from C is:
;
;  extern char kbdfly();
;  char extended_char;
;  char waiting_char;
;
;  waiting_char = kbdfly( &extended_char );
;  if ( waiting_char )
;     /* regular character was returned */
;  else {
;     if ( extended_char )
;        /* extended character was returned */
;     else
;        /* no character was returned */
;  }
;
