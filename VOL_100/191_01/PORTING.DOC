                   Notes on Porting CLINK

    File CLINK80.C is the original C/80 program compilable with
    Software Toolworks C/80 for 8080 and Z-80 machines using
    CP/M or Heath HDOS.

    File CLINK.C is the same program with some minor changes
    that make it compilable by Mix C.  This version should be
    fairly easy to port to other compilers.  Very
    likely, some #defines would have to be changed, depending
    on what is and is not defined in the stdio file.  The
    /*$SIGNEXT*/ is a parameter setting for Mix C, telling it to
    do sign extension on converting chars to ints.  The /*$ZERO*/
    is a parameter setting for Mix C telling it to zero memory
    allocated by calloc().  Compilers which do not and can not
    be made to do these two things will not produce correct
    results.  The CLINK program would require extensive changes.

    I just (7-10-86) compiled the 5-31-86 version (file CLINK.C)
    with Software Toolworks MS-DOS version of C. I only had to
    change the #include "stdio" to #include "a:stdio.h".

    We at Cleveland State University now have a C compiler for
    our central IBM mainframe system.  I have not tried it yet.  If it
    uses EBCDIC instead of ASCII, that will mean trouble for
    a lot of programs, including CLINK which assumes ASCII in
    several places.  The EBCDIC alphabet is interrupted by some
    non-alphabetical characters somewhere between A and Z.
    The numerals are ok though.
