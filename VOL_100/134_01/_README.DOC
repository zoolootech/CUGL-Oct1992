     ____                                                                NOTE: Certain of the programs on this disc are copyright (c) 
1983 by Kevin Kenny.  They have been released to the Users' Group 
                                ____     for non-commercial distribution only.  

     This  disc  contains  the  source  code for several programs
which provide enhancements to the BDS 'C' environment.   Most  of
these  programs  extend the capabilities of the compiler, in much
the same spirit  as  the  very  successful  "Compiler  Utilities"
disc.  

     Full  documentation is provided in machine-readable form for
the programs.  All of the documentation files  are  intended  for
processing  by the NRO text formatter, available as "Utilities V"
from the Users' Group.  The program documentation  is  mostly  in
the  form  of  "manual  pages"  which  follow  Stephen Browning's
recommended style.  

     Installation instructions for  all  the  programs  are  also
provided.   The  file  INSTALL.NRO  is  an  NRO  source for these
directions.   

     The file -CATALOG.DOC is a list of the files provided,  with
a short  description  of  each.  The following programs appear on
this disc: 

_____    CASM2: 

     This program provides a replacement for CASM, the CRL-format 
ASM preprocessor supplied with BDS 'C'. It has been  enhanced  to
allow   access   to   the   external   variable   area  from  the
assembly-language  code,  to  permit  underscores  as   part   of
identifiers  (transliterating  them  to  'Q's  so  that ASM won't
complain), and to handle relocation directives under  conditional
assembly.   The  usage  of  CASM2  is exactly the same as that of
CASM, so no documentation file has been supplied.  

_______    CMDUTIL: 

     This is a collection  of  subroutines  intended  mainly  for
processing  the  argc and argv passed to the main program in 'C'.
It provides a common  processing  for  option  abbreviations  and
keyword  values,  and  a  common  procedure  to  display  command
syntax.  It also includes an 'initv' procedure that is similar to 
'initw' but can handle octal, hex, and symbolic constants as well 
as decimal numbers.  

____    CORO: 

     This  is  a  subroutine   library   for   the   support   of
'coroutines',    a   way   to   simulate   multi-tasking   on   a
single-threaded machine.  A verbose description of coroutines and 
how they operate is in the file CORODOC.NRO; the specifics of the 
package are described in CORO.NRO.

________                                             CPROFILE: (Requires BDS 'C' release 1.50 or later) 

     This is a "profiler" for BDS 'C' programs.   For  each  line
in  a  target program, it lists the number of times that line was
executed on a particular run.  This  information  is  useful  for
debugging and in performance analysis.  

____                                             CTOA: (Requires BDS 'C' release 1.50 or later) 

     This is a disassembler for BDS 'C' object code.  It produces 
a source file acceptable to CASM2 which generates the same object 
program that a 'C' source did.  It is useful in understanding how 
the compiler  operates.   It may also be used (God forbid!) to ge
assembly language source for modification or transport to another 
environment.  

____    DIFF: 

     This is a program to compare  two  text  files  and  give  a
listing of   their   differences.    It  handles  insertions  and
deletions correctly, so can be used with  files  such  as  source
programs  to  determine  the  changes  made  between    different
versions.  

______    GENREL: 

     This is a utility program that extracts relocation data from 
a function on a .CRL file.   It  is  used  as  part  of  building
CPROFILE,  to  enable  the run-time supervisor to be relocated to
high memory.  

_____    RETAB: 

     This is a sample  program  to  illustrate  the  use  of  the
coroutine package.    See  CORODOC.NRO  for  a description of its
use.
