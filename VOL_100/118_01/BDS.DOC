Primitives

   The following files contain the software tools primitives
written in BDS C:

TOOLS.H, DATE.BDS, FILE.BDS, RAWFILE.BDS, ARGS.BDS, MISC.BDS,
STORAGE.BDS, STRING.BDS, CONVERT.BDS, SYMTAB.BDS, and
PATTERN.BDS.

   The file TOOLS.H contains all global variables and
declarations used by the BDS C version of the software
tools primitives.
This file must be used in ALL programs instead of BDSCIO.H.
This file contains portions of BDSCIO.H and RATDEF.
See the file TOOLS.H for more comments.

   The files FILE.BDS, RAWFILE.BDS, ARGS.BDS, MISC.BDS
implement the I/O primitives and I/O redirection.
(MISC.BDS contains some odds and ends.)
I have been using them for several months now with no problems.

   The file STORAGE.BDS contains the dynamic storage allocation
primitives.
This file simply calls the BDS C allocation primitives.

   The file STRING.BDS contains string manipulation primitives.
Not all the primitives on this file have been debugged.

   The file CONVERT.BDS contains various conversion utility
routines.
Not all of the routines on this file have been converted from
RATFOR to BDS C.
The ones that have not been converted are commented out.

   The file SYMTAB.BDS contains symbol table creation,
deletion, and lookup routines.
These routines are used by the ROFF program,
but you still might want to
revise them extensively.
There are more comments on the file SYMTAB.BDS.

   The file PATTERN.BDS contains pattern-matching and
set manipulation primitives.
None of the primitives on this file have been completely
converted to BDS C and debugged.
Indeed, the primitives on this file are in various stages;
some are mostly RATFOR still while others are mostly BDS C.

   The file TOOLIB1.BDS contains most of the library routines
from STDLIB1.BDS and STDLIB2.BDS.
Some of the routines were modified for use with the directed
I/O routines.
Some of the names of routines were changed to avoid conflicts.
Some of the BDS C routines were deleted.
See the comments on the file TOOLIB1.BDS for more details.

   The file TOOLIB2.CRL contains the object for all the
BDS C routines which are written in assembly language.
Note that some of the names in this file have been changed.
This file was, of course, created with CLIB.

   The file COPY.BDS is a test propram for the primitives.
The file ARGS.BDS also contains a main() function which is
a test of I/O redirection.
The file SYMTAB.BDS contains a main() function which is
a test of the symbol table primitives.

   The .SUB files on this disk are SUBMIT files used to
compile or link the primitives.
The file TOOLS.SUB simply compiles all the primitives.

   The files LINKARGS.SUB, LINKCOPY.SUB, and SYMLINK.SUB
link the files ARGS.BDS, COPY.BDS, and SYMTAB.BDS.
Note that linking all the primitives together is fairly
complicated at this stage.

Utilities and documentation

   The file RAT2C.BDS is a filter which converts RATFOR-style
comments into BDS C style comments.
At present this program is the only tool that I have for
converting RATFOR programs to C program.

   The file CONVR2C.DOC tells what has to be done to convert
programs from RATFOR to C.
You may be surprised (or shocked) to see how difficult it is.

  The file CHANGES.DOC tells what changes should or could
be made to the primitives.
The contents of this file are only opinions, but I hope
they will form a starting point for future discussions.

   The file FILE.DOC tells how the primitives implement
I/O redirection.
Some of this information can also be found on TOOLS.H.
