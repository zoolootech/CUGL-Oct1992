Re:   UMODEM Version 2.7

        The latest version of UMODEM, the UNIX version of XMODEM,
 is now available.

        Thanks TONS to Bennett  Marks  for  his  transportability
conversion to UNIX Version 7 (his release is UMODEM Version 2.6).
I think he did a superior job!  This new UMODEM (Version 2.7)  is
an  enhancement of his upgrade.  To compile it for your UNIX sys-
tem, the following command lines are recommended:

cc -7 umodem.c -o umodem -DJHU  <-- for JHU UNIX
cc -7 umodem.c -o umodem -DVER7 <-- for Version 7 UNIX - (I'm not
				    sure -7 is required)

        Version 2.7 includes the Version 7 UNIX transportability,
a  status  option  (y)  which  gives  the user file size and CP/M
record count information for his up/down loading  time  estimate,
and  a  7-bit  transmission option (7) which masks out the MSB of
either protocol (TERM II FTP 1 or FTP 3 [CP/M  UG  Protocol])  so
that  a  modified MODEM2 or TERM II can transceive text files via
UMODEM on the ARPA Net.  The ARPA Net problems (bah, humbug!) are
still not resolved, but I'm working on them.

        Enjoy, and thanks for all the interest!
