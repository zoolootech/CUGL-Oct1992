			ENVIRONMENT DIVISION

	All programs were either developed or modified to run under
BDS C version 1.41 under CP/M 1.4, using a standard S-100 bus (Imsai
w/Z-80 uC), 40k bytes of memory, dual single/double density floppies
(only one floppy, single density is required for any of these programs).
Most programs are fairly small and should run (and compile) in 32k or
less.

	Certain programs (e.g., chargen) make use of memory-mapped VIO,
in an 80 char x 24 line format, and simple graphic characters.
These can be easily modified to 64x16, and/or standard ASCII characters.
See the comments within "chargen" for more info. on the graphics.

	All these programs were compiled with a slightly modified
version of the standard "deff" library. None of these changes are
required in order to recompile and run; only the esthetics are different.

	The value of NSECTS is set to 8.

	The _spr function used by printf, et al., was modified for
	"prolog.c", as described in READ-ME.DOC and the file "printf.c".

	The getc function was modified for "bin2hex.c", as described
	in READ-ME.DOC and the file "getc.c".
