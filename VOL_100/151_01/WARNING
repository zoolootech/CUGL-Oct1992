WARNING!!!


	Ed Ream's screen editor, CUG114 for BDS C, CUG115 for Small C and CUG
	151 for IBM's are not to be confused with his more sophiscated  Red
	editor now bundled with BDS C 1.6 or offered seperately from Enteleki.
	Ream notes that CUG114 & CUG115 public domain versions are very earlyÿ
	versions predecessors of the Red editor and that they have relatively
	little in common with the current commercial product.
