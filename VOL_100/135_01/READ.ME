files:		size:	contents:

math.csm	22k	Very high precision math subroutine package
			as adapted and corrected from the March 1977
			Dr. Dobb's Journal article by M.G. Dinneley
			by way of an M80 version by Thomas Hill (see
			the June and July 1983 issues of Lifelines).
			this version corrects errors common to both of
			its predicessors as well as making the transition
			to BDSc's csm format.  
math.crl	8k	crl version of math.csm

vli.csm		14k	a 'front end' for math.crl.  This contains all
			of the named subroutine calls for BDSc as well
			as all of the housekeeping necessary to use math.crl.
			At last count there were some 37 functions available
			to BDSc with 5 more for odds and ends.  While I
			would not recommend any of my csm files as highly
			optimized, this one is at least easy to extend with
			new functions as needed.
vli.crl		4k	crl version of vli.csm

qpm.csm		4k	An example of extensions to vli.csm.  This contains
			two functions that test either a string or an integer
			for primality.  If the number is 1>n>65536, these
			functions will return TRUE or FALSE as the result of
			a seive test for "is n prime?"  Otherwise TRUE, FALSE
			or MAYBE is returned.  For an example of usage, see
			the program prime.c.   
qpm.crl		2k	crl version of qpm.crl (what else??!!?)

calc.c		12k	A reverse polish programmable calculator based somewhat
			on the HP11c.

e.c		2k	Program that does nothing but compute 'e' to some
			desired number of digits beyond the decimal...(is
			that like beyond the pale?)

m.c		2k	An implementation of Fermat's little theorem
			as a practical test of primality for microcomputers.
			(I'm not all that sure of just how practical!)

ratc.c		4k	A set of rational number functions (add, subtract,
			multiply and divide) as an extension to the system.

prime.c		2k	Need large prime numbers?  This is a program that
			will generate them, up to 99 digits as is, more with
			modification to the source.  For instance did you
			know that 78232933534123632256464644356789655637924
			573111259 is prime?  This program is a great eater
			of time so use it accordingly.  Note also its use of
			a function from qpm.crl; qprime(s).

sqr1.c		2k	A demonstration of how an s100 computer and BDSc
			can compute 1.0000001^134217728 with 50 digits of
			accuracy.  See the April l984 issue of Scientific
			American's Computer Recreations column.

v.c		6k	In source a series of examples on vli function calls,
			as compiled, a demonstration of how they work.

p.c		2k	Algorithm P...a probabilistic primality test.  From
			"Seminumerical Algorithms: The Art of Computer 
			Programming", Vol. 2, by D. E. Knuth.

read.me		nk	this, and you are.
