	The C version of PISTOL v2.0 was developed with BDS
C compiler, version 1.45a and the L2 linker version 2.2 on
an Exidy Sorcerer personal Computer with the S-100 expansion
box. The Thinker Toys 2D dual 8" disk sub- system was used
and total contiguous ram was 52K.  Statistics from the BDS
compiler indicated at least 14K left over at every stage.
Thus it may be possible to recompile this in a 40K system.

	To run PISTOL.COM I believe the minimum RAM is 44K
(this includes CP/M since the program code and all its
buffers occupy about 33K).

	I/O requirements are minimal.  A dumb terminal (video
or printing) and the CP/M disk interface are sufficient.

	In use, the user may wish to customize PISTOL by
declaring his actual screen width (I have defaulted to 64).
Also the output scrolls and pauses after a fixed number of
lines (my default is 20?).  To continue, hit return, to abort
type "q" before "return".  Even the tab size for display is
user alterable.  See the documentation about the "system
variables": TERMINAL-WIDTH , TERMINAL-LENGTH , and TAB-SIZE .

	To run type:

A>pistol

X>'core2 restore		[note the initial apostrophe!]
*** PISTOL 2.0 ***

(March 10, 1982)

	It is expected that several major extensions to
PISTOL can and will be possible for some installations.

	Extended PISTOL versions will be denoted by certain
letter conventions (which follow the version number).  For
example, *** PISTOL 2.0A *** would be used for a version
possessing assembly capabilities.  If several extensions
coexist, necessitating several letter suffixes, they should
appear in alphabetical order (e.g. PISTOL
