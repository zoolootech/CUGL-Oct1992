	this program compresses/expands any valid ASCII text
	file. the CP/M CRLF sequence is replaced by NL, and
	strings of identical characters of greater than 3 bytes
	are reduced to 3 bytes in the following format:

		byte 1:	repeat code	RCODE	000Q
		byte 2: repeat count	cntr	---Q
		byte 3:	character	c	---Q

	in addition, the most common key-words of various
	languages (BASIC, ASSEMBLER, FORTRAN, etc.), as
	well as a number of miscellaneous strings, are
	tokenized to 1 byte. the average total disk space
	saved is approximately 20%. processing time is
	approximately 30" for a 10K file with read-after-
	write (RAW) in a 40K system.

	considerable protection has been built in to avoid
	such disasters as compressing a compressed file or
	expanding an ordinary file. the following chart
	summarizes legal and illegal modes:

	normal file	<----------------->	compressed file

	    /C					    /E

	.ASM	--->	assembler source	<---	.$AS
	.BAS	--->	CBASIC source		<---	.$BA
	.C	--->	C source		<---	.$C
	.COB	--->	COBOL source		<---	.$CO
	.DAT	--->	general data file	<---	.$DA
	.DOC	--->	general documentation	<---	.$DO
	.FOR	--->	FORTRAN source		<---	.$FO
	.LIB	--->	library source		<---	.$LI
	.MAC	--->	macro-assembler source	<---	.$MA
	.MBA	--->	MBASIC source         	<---	.$MB
			(requires verification)
	.RAT	--->	RATFOR source		<---	.$RA
	.SRC	--->	PASCAL source		<---	.$SR
	.TXT	--->	general text file	<---	.$TX
			(requires verification)

	all other operations are considered illegal and the
	program will abort. note that all files which have
	been processed with earlier versions of COMPRESS will
	be handled correctly by this version and any future
	versions will be upward-compatible.

	the supplied version requires a minimum of 40K in
	which to operate. note also that there must be 
	sufficient space on the disk to hold both the
	compressed and normal files during processing. upon
	successful completion, the original file (normal
	in the case of compression - compressed in the case
	of expansion) is deleted.

	compressed files should be PIPed using the [O] option.
