The original source for this Small-C compiler was copied from
"Small-C Compiler, v.2" in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Numbers 74 and 75,
December 1982 and January 1983.  Author: J. E. Hendrix.
 
The accompanying article contains the following statement by Hendrix:
 
"This version of Small-C is copyrighted as a revision to Ron Cain's
original work.  It is, nevertheless, available to the general public
for use without formal restrictions.  Take it, use it, copy it, modify
it, and give it away as you please.  If you capitalize on it for profit,
I ask only that you compensate the principal authors in a manner that
seems fair to you."
 
Hendrix's address is Rt. 1, Box 74-B-1, Oxford, MS 38665.
 
The work of entering the source from the printed listings was performed
by a group of IBM employees as an informal project of the Rochester,
Minnesota IBM Club's Personal Computing Interest Group.
 
The code attributable to Hendrix is contained in the following source files:
 
   CC.DEF   CC1.C    CC11.C   CC12.C   CC13.C   CC2.C    CC21.C
   CC22.C   CC3.C    CC31.C   CC32.C   CC4.C    CC41.C   CC42.C
 
This code is also present, in compiled form, in CC.EXE.  All other
code delivered with this compiler, including the CC5 optimizer routines,
the basic STDIO.C routines, and the I/O and utility library, are the
original work of D. R. Hicks.
 
Any use, copying, or distribution of this compiler should be consistent
with these statements.
