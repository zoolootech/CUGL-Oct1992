          XC  -  A 'C' Concordance (XREF) Utility
          =======================================

'XC' is a cross-reference utility for 'C' programs.  Its has the
ability to handle nested include files to a depth of 8 levels and
properly processes nested comments.  Option flags support the
following features:

- Routing of list output to disk
- Cross-referencing of reserved words
- Processing of nested include files
- Generation of listing only
- Output page width

Usage: xc <filename> ...  <flag(s)>

All files listed are crossreferenced together.  The veriable listing
will show every occurance, for example, of 'var' in every file.

Flags: -i            = Enable file inclusion
       -l            = Generate listing only
       -r            = Cross-ref reserved words
       -o <filename> = Write output to named file
       -w width      = Width of output page; default=78

       Flags must follow all filenames

Examples:

       xc my.c

       xc main.c sub1.c sub2.c sub3.c -o xref.lst -w 120

PC Enhancements include:
     1)  Nested #INCLUDE statements
     2)  Single spaced cross-reference list
     3)  Removal of tabbing on output device
         (Since many printers don't support it)
     4)  #INCLUDE statements with both "--" and <-->
         syntax and with a full fileid in the quotes.
         (Paths are not supported.)
     5)  Multiple input filenames on command line.

The current PC version only supports Lattice.  Conversion to others
should be relatively easy but see the compile time variable "Lattice"
for compiler specific sections.
