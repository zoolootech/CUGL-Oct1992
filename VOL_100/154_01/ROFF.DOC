     This  is a transliteration of the text formatting program on Kernighan
     & Plauger's SOFTWARE TOOLS, with some modifications to take  advantage
     of  the  power of C. If the summary of dot commands below isn't enough
     for you, see the book.
     
     Most commands can accept arguments. If the argument is preceded  by  a
     plus  or  minus sign then the current value of the indicated attribute
     is changed by that amount. For example, the command  .ls  2  sets  the
     line   spacing   to   2,  while  the  command  .ls  +2  increases  the
     currently-set line spacing by 2 lines.

     A break stops the filling of  the  current  line.  Breaks  are  needed
     between  paragraphs.  Lines containing nothing but blanks always cause
     one blank line to be output. A line which starts with a tab  or  blank
     causes  the  temporary  indent  setting  to  be  set  to the number of
     beginning spaces on that line. Note that this  feature  overrides  any
     .ti setting in effect.
