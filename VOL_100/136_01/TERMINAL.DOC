This disk contains games
and  a  (quasi-)universal  terminal  definition  system.   Before 
running  any of the other programs,  run TERMINAL to  create  the 
file   TERMINAL.
 Other   terminal  configuration   methods 
described  in  your  newsletter  don't  allow  for  object   code 
portability,  whereas  this  one does and has been used with  not 
only C but also BASIC,  Pascal and assembler. The games were fun 
projects of mine and I've decided to put them all into the public 
domain.  I only learned C recently,  so two were converted  from 
Basic,  the  other from assembler (Don't criticize my C too much! 
Give  me  a  chance!).   They  are  written  in  C/80  (Software 
Toolworks),  which  means they should be easily portable  to  any 
Unix-compatible C.

Here is a listing of the files on the disk:

DUMPSTAR.C, .SUB, .COM -  Dump Star video game
TZ.C, .R, .COM, .DOC -  Twilight Zone adventure game

  NO FAIR READING TZ.R! (Maybe we ought to squeeze it?)

CMAZE.C, .SUB, .COM -     Perspective maze game
   (Careful - doesn't use TERMINAL.SYS; also does direct
   port I/O to an AY-3-9513 Cricket at ports B0,B1 hex)
TERMINAL.C, .COM, .DOC -   Terminal configuration program
RDTERM.C, .COM -       Check your terminal configuration
RANDOM.C -          Random function for C/80
PORTIO.C -          I/O port access for C/80
CUG.LTR -           this letter

Someone can probably improve upon my random number generator. It 
is  pretty crude.  If anyone installs any terminals beyond  what 
TERMINAL  supports,  I'd like to get a copy of the new values  so 
that the program can be enhanced.
.pa
Other projects I have underway are a 68000 cross-assembler and an 
operating system. Once the cross-assembler is complete I want to 
make  a  small-C for the 68000 which will then be used  with  the 
operating  system  as  well as  other  projects.  Currently  the 
operating system is in Z80 assembler.  When this is finished  it 
will  all become public domain.  If anyone is working on similar 
projects, I'd sure like to get in touch with them.

Have fun and ... C you later!

HOW TO CONFIGURE OUR PROGRAMS
FOR YOUR SYSTEM -

All  Third Planet Productions programs are configured by means of 
a universal Terminal File. This file is read by programs written 
in BASIC,  PASCAL and assembler,  and will be used in all  future 
TPP  software  releases as well.  The programmers out there  are 
encouraged to use it as well.

The first step in configuring the program is to find out
WHAT KIND OF TERMINAL YOU HAVE.
If you have a Televideo 950, STOP! That's the default.

There  is  a library of terminal configurations which comes  with 
the program (TERMINAL.LIC).  Your terminal/computer might be  in 
the library already. 
The configurations currently supported are:

   TeleVideo 920   TeleVideo 950   Visual 200   Heath H19
   Osborne I     ANSI Standard   MAX-80     Hazeltine
   Perkin-Elmer Fox DEC VT-52

If  the configuration you need is not in the  library,  you  will 
need  to  get  your  terminal manual and  look  up  your  control 
sequences.  Some  of  the terminals included in the library  are 
listed here a little later.  Backed up by this,  you're ready to 
bring up the TERMINAL program (TERMINAL.COM).   This is done  as 
follows:

A>TERMINAL (Double width shows what you type in)

Which console do you wish to configure? In a single-user system, 
it's always console 0 (zero). In multi-user MP/M configurations, 
each console may be a different terminal type.

If you can use one of the configurations supplied in the  library 
then use the R option in the program. When you select R you will 
be asked if you wish to configure for a variety of terminals. If 
you  don't  wish  to  use a particular  configuration  answer  N; 
otherwise  answer  Y  and the program will be set  to  use  that 
terminal/computer.  It's that simple!

If  there  isn't  an entry in the library that  applies  to  your 
machine  then  you  will  need to  use  the  C  option.  Control 
characters  should  be  entered as a ^ (caret)  followed  by  the 
upper-case letter.  For example,  control-R would be entered  as 
^R. In particular, the escape code (ESC) would be entered as ^[. 
The Home command for a Televideo would be entered as ^^.

Few  of the programs use all of the various entries in the  file. 
Most   will  operate  with  just  the  Clear  Screen  and  Cursor 
Addressing parameters.
.pa
After  you enter your codes you might want to enter them into the 
library for future use. You can do this with the A option. (You 
might want to test your configuration before putting it into  the 
library.  If  so,then you can test it using the method explained 
in  the next paragraph.  Then you can reenter TERMINAL  and  add 
your settings to the library.) 

You can test how well your terminal is configured by running  the 
RDTERM program:

A>RDTERM

The various messages printed test what they say they are testing.
(Honest!)

If  you are unable to decipher your terminal manual,  please feel 
free  to  write us.  In fact,  when you order  programs  in  the 
future, mention the type of terminal you have, and we may be able 
to  pass along some information on how to configure it better for 
our  software.  Also if you have a configuration that we do  not 
support,  we  would appreciate hearing from you:  either  in  the 
questionaire, your next order or in a separate note.)

      TERMINAL FILE FORMAT

This  document describes the file format of the standard terminal 
definition  file.  This  file is generated by a  program  called 
TERMINAL.COM and is named TERMINAL.SYS.

The  file has a record length of 128 characters,  divided into 16 
8-byte  fields.  There  is  one record for each console  in  the 
system. Each field consists of a 0 to 7 ASCII characters, padded 
with  at  least one null.  If the function is  unavailable,  the 
first byte should be a null.

In most cases,  the entire field can be printed.  In the case of 
cursor  addressing,  this is not advisable.  The following BASIC 
function can be used to truncate the field string:

DEF FNS$(O$)=LEFT$(O$,INSTR(O$,CHR$(0))-1)

Field  Mnemonic  Description

 1         Miscellaneous parameters:
     WIDTH      1 Screen width in columns (1 byte)
     HEIGHT      2 Screen height in lines (1 byte)
     DEFINT      3 Default intensity: 'L'=Low 'H'=High
     USELST      4 Use last: 'Y'=Can print in last position
               without scrolling
          Cursor addressing parameters:
     SNDFST      5 Send first: 'Y' or 'X'
     METHOD      6 Method: '0'=Binary
               '1'=ASCII-Decimal, req'd no. of chars
               '2'=ASCII-Decimal, 2 characters
               '3'=ASCII-Decimal, 3 characters
     XADD       7 X addend
     YADD       8 Y addend

 2   INISTR   Initialization string
             (put terminal into ANSI mode, etc.)

           Some Typical Terminals

The following are some of the settings for the terminals that are 
in  the  terminal library.  When entering your  own  codes,  the 
character  ^  (caret) followed by an  upper-case  character  will 
cause  the corresponding control character to be entered into the 
file.  Control characters should not be entered directly.  Note 
that TERMINAL will also display the functions in this format  for 
verification by the user.

NOTES:

The  character  at  the end of the ANSI sequence for CURON  is  a 
small letter L.

INISTR is not shown.  To use a Heath H-19 in ANSI mode,  install 
as ANSI,  but use ^[< for INISTR.  HIINT and LOINT will not have 
any visible effect on an H-19.
