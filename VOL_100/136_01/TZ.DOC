                        The Twilight Zone
                         Adventure Game

       ================================================


Hardware

     The  Twilight Zone Adventure Game requires a CP/M-compatible 
operating system with a Z80 processor and 32K of TPA space.  This 
implies a RAM memory size of at least 40 to 48K.


Adventure Games

     In  case you are unfamiliar with adventure games (where have 
you  been?),  here is a quick rundown.   An adventure game is  an 
alternate universe in which you can do various things in order to 
achieve  a certain goal.   You will start in a given location  at 
the beginning of the game.  You can examine your surroundings and 
then  move on to another location.   Some adventure games require 
you  to gather treasure and gain the maximum number of points  by 
the end of the game.   Others require you to perform a particular 
action in order to win.   In any case, the outcome of the game is 
determined by where you go and what you do.


The Twilight Zone Game

     You  accomplish  things  in this game  by  giving  two  word 
sentences which consist of a verb and a noun.

     You  can  move around by typing the verb GO followed by  the 
direction you wish to go.   The main directions used in the  game 
are NORTH,  SOUTH,  EAST,  WEST,  UP, DOWN, IN, and OUT.  You can 
also use one letter abbreviations (N,  S,  E,  W,  U, D, I and O) 
without a verb.  There are a few other directions you can go, but 
you must learn these from playing the game.

     It  is very important to carefully assess your  surroundings 
as  you travel around.   You can do this by using the words  LOOK 
and EXAMINE followed by the name of the object to be looked at.

     It will take you awhile to solve this game.   Since it would 
be  very tedious to start from the beginning every time you  want 
to  play the game a SAVE command is provided.   Use this  command 
when  you are finished with a session or when you are about to do 
something that you think may not necessarily  work out.   At  any 
time  you  can  use  the LOAD command  to  retrieve  the  earlier 
position in the game.

     There are several other commands which can be used which you 
will discover as you play the game.

     The object of the Twilight Zone Adventure Game is one of the 
first things that you must discover.   Certain clues will only be 
given  once,  so you must pay close attention to all that goes on 
around you.   If you get "stuck",  try talking to a friend who is 
familiar with the game and take a close look at all of the  clues 
that you have collected.

     This  game has a very large universe.   It is essential that 
you  make  maps as you go along.   Look out for traps  and  mazes 
which  will be particularly hard to find your way around  in  and 
out of.

               ====================

     With these suggestions we hope that you find your trip to be 
a  pleasant one.   Remember the land in which you are  travelling 
and that anything can happen.  You are moving into a land of both 
shadow  and substance,  of things and ideas.  You've just crossed 
over into ...

                 The Twilight Zone.
