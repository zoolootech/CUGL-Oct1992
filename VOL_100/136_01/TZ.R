^Aileen is here.She smiles to you and whispers."Hello.Listen,we've got to work together. There are six digits in the code-- Do you have any idea what they are?"
^In comes Aileen,looking very upset."Hi",she says listlessly."Any ideas? I've got to find out that number sequence!"
^Aileen is here with a strange-looking device of some sort.She has a very angry look on her face."If you aren't going to help me,I'm going to kill you!",she says.
^A blue-white flash near your head."What is the answer?",comes Aileen's voice.
^There is a funny-looking man near you! "Oh,you don't have to say hello," he says quickly,nodding his red hat."I'm the Answer Man,and I'm here to help you.See,here you were wondering who I was,and I told you! That's your first answer right there!" And he disappears!
^"You noticed me! At least you aren't sleeping!"\It's the Answer Man again,in green suit and red felt hat."Sometimes it's good to go to sleep.It all depends on where you are,I guess."
^"Well,life always has its ups and downs," says the funny-looking man,rushing up and rushing off."Sometimes it takes a little scare to get things moving again."
^Oh! The Answer Man! "Need a hand? Remember,it's just a game,like Poker or Yahtzee.Sometimes you don't even know what your hand is!"
^"Hi,it's me again!",says the Answer Man,once again appearing out of nowhere."You know,sometimes I like to take a little time to watch TV,don't you? Well,I'll be seeing you!" He disappears again.
^"Fancy meeting you again!" It's the Answer Man again."We sure do seem to run into each other quite often...then again,there must be dozens of minutes in an hour!"
^"What's the best place to keep safe?" queries the Answer Man,as he appears suddenly (as usual)."Why,in a jail,of course!" Then he dashes off,laughing to himself.An odd sort!
^The Answer Man is here again."I've told you all I can...Isn't it funny though? I haven't told you anything you didn't already know."
^There is a man in a dark suit here.He is staring off,as though talking to someone else.\"Submitted for your approval: An innocent computer game. A journey into the imagination.Who can say where the game ends,and reality begins? The answer lies somewhere in the Twilight Zone."
^The man in the dark suit reappears,again staring off as though talking to someone else.\"A person in search of something-- but what? You open this door with the key of imagination."
^The man in the dark suit is here again.He is talking into the distance."How deep are the depths of despair? We know them like the back of our hands.Is it some thing that can be seen,smelled,felt,tasted or heard? Is it something we can count on our fingers?"
^"A puzzle like any other.Simple,child's play",intones the man in the dark suit."But this time it is a very different kind of puzzle-- the kind of puzzle that only has a solution in the Twilight Zone."
^The man in the dark suit is standing in the corner,speaking as though to someone else."The reality that surrounds us-- is it immutable,unchangable? Is it plastic,alterable? Or does it just flicker across the ether,a show put on by our imagination?"
^"The desert," lectures the man in the dark suit,"a place where life and hope wither in the heat.It is a stifling prison without walls,a graveyard of broken dreams."
^Once again,the man in the dark suit speaks into the dark distance."A person trapped in a world of his own imagination,where the answer could be as far away as the stars,or as near as his own closet."
^The man in the dark suit appears again.
