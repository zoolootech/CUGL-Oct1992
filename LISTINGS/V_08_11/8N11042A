              2. Block reading queue via DosReadQueue.
              3. DosGetSeg on passed pointer to insure access.
              4. DosSizeSeg to insure valid segment length.
              5. Process the request represented by the record.
              6. DosFreeSeg to free shared memory segment.
              7. Go to #2.



              1. Open the queue via DosOpenQueue.
              2. Allocate the memory segment via DosAllocSeg.
              3. Construct the queue record in the memory segment.
              4. Give the segment to the queue owner via DosGiveSeg
                 (Owners Process ID is returned from DosOpenQueue).
              5. Write record to queue via DosWriteQueue.
              6. Free the memory segment via DosFreeSeg (the segment
                 will not actually be destroyed since access was given
                 to the queue owner).
              7. Go to #2.
