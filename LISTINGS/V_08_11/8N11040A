         DosCreateQueue            Creates a queue, assigns queue
                                   name, and determines owner process.
         DosOpenQueue              Opens an existing queue to allow a
                                   client to add records.  Returns
                                   queue handle and owner PID.
         DosCloseQueue             Terminates access to a queue and

                                   called by the owner, the queue is
                                   destroyed.
