cstr - Produce compilable C STRing from a text file.

Syntax:
     cstr file.str

Where:
   file.str
       is the name of a file containing text.  The filename need not end
       in  ".str",  but  it  cannot  end in ".c" (since the output would
       destroy the input).

Description:
     From a text file, cstr produces a C file containing a character ar-
ray  named  after  the input file and initialized with its text.  If the
first line of the text file is of the form:

     &name size

it will be taken to indicate the name and dimension (in  bytes)  of  the
character array.  The "size" specification is optional.
