Spacing Test

This test is designed to
test whether my machine removes spaces.

Real paragraphs are marked by double space.

They are also marked by indents but
listings, such as:

   start:   mov   a,b

            xra   a

            ret

are not marked quite the same.

My algorithm should correct both, but
may mess up on tabs.
