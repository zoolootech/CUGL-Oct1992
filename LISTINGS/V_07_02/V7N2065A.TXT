/*********
*    NAME:	STRATEGY		(a far function)
*     USE:	Store the address of the request header for later
*			processing by DOSIO. This is the classic "strategy" routine
*			as described in Device Driver manuals. DOS passes the request
*			header and this routine saves it for DOSIO (the "interrupt"
*			routine) to parse.
*			Can be done in C with pseudo variables (but ASM is tighter): 
*				ptr.address.offset = _BX;
*				ptr.address.segment = _ES;
*   INPUT:	void
*  OUTPUT:	void
