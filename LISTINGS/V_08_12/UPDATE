1/9/91: JOHNSON.ZIP added, containing the complete, original code
        for Marcus Johnson's article. The assembly portions were
        accidentally omitted from the text in the original article.

        NOTE: There are two levels of directories in JOHNSON.ZIP.
        to unzip, use the command:
                 pkunzip -d johnson

11/14/90: The files tc_mouse.h and tc_mouse.asm were added, supplementing
          the material published for Michael Kelly's "Buffering Mouse
          Events" article.
