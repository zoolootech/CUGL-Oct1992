*      lock_write() - write shared data to a network file
*
*      Parameters:
*             handle (in) - file handle to read from
*             buffer (in) - buffer to place data in
*             length (in) - number of bytes to read
*
*      Returns:
*             Return code is identical to write()
*
*      Notes:
*             1.     This routine assumes that the record to be written
*                    was previously read using lock_read().
*
*      History:
*             Original code by William H. Roetzheim, 1989
