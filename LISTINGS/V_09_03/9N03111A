
In this example, the size of a data pointer is 2, and the size 
of a function pointer is 2
The data to be accessed is as follows:

The array provides access to...
This is field one
Here's the second field
Field Three at your service
Art was here

Each function returns the count of clock ticks.  The lower the better.

Accessing UsingS_Object(): result = 14
Accessing UsingStructure(): result = 18
Accessing UsingArray(): result = 16
Accessing UsingStrucAndArrayBoth()(: result = 25
Accessing EmptyLoop(): result = 8
Accessing LoopToLoop(): result = 57
Accessing OneLoop(): result = 48

1. Sum of time for (UsingStructure + UsingArray) = 34
2. Sum less time for both in one loop = 9
3. Time to do an empty loop = 8
4. Error (item 3 less item 2 should be near zero) = -1
