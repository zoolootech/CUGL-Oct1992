*************************  FILENAME CONVENTION *******************************

Most filenames on this disk are configured with a volume number, an issue
number, a page number and an alphabetic letter, as follows:

	vNiipppc

where
	v   = volumne number
	N   = the letter N
	ii  = issue number
	ppp = page number
	c   = A for first on page, B for 2nd on page, etc.
	

For example, 8N04121A would be the first listing on page 121 in
volume number 8 issue number 4.

If there are additional files (that did not appear in the actual article)
supplied to us by authors for inclusion in the code disk, they will be
