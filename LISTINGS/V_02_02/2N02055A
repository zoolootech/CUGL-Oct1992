    TESTSFHT.C  -  Microsoft C ver 5.1

    A driver used to validate the assembly language
    functions max_sys_file_handles() and
    sys_handles_in_use().

    From the command line, executing this program
    will print the following line.
         Total system handles available: [n]
         System handles in use: [i]
    where n is the number of file handles specified
    in the CONFIG.SYS FILES=n directive and i is the
    number of system file information blocks which are
    active.  If no CONFIG.SYS file was found at boot
    time, or there was no FILES=n statement, or the
    FILES=n statement had n < 8, n will equal 8.  If
    run from the DOS command line without redirection,
    i will equal 3.  Output redirected to a file will
    increase i by 1.

    Test the driver with varying values n in the
    CONFIG.SYS FILES=n statement.  Remember to reboot
    after changing the CONFIG.SYS.
