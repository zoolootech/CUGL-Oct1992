        fibonacci table:

            demonstrates using REPT block to initialize data

            unfortunately Masm 5.0 constants are limited to 16 bits
            so the table is shorter than I'd like
            
            C Program considers table an unsigned int array
            
                extern unsigned fib_table[24]

        Version 1.0 Small Memory Model
        
            To assemble with Masm V. 5.0 -- masm /b60 /Ml fibtable;
