/******************************************************
* dg_read - read a datagram over the network
* Parameters:
*   number (in) - your name table address number
*   from (out)  - name of user sending datagram
*   buffer (in) - location to put received data
*   length (in) - maximum number of bytes to receive
* Global: net_error - used to store NetBIOS return 
*                     code for error processing.
* Returns: Number of bytes received for success, 
*          -1 for failure
* Notes: Number is the value returned from a successful 
*        init_netbios(). This code assumes that you are 
*        using a memory model which will result in 
*        buffer being a far pointer. From must point to 
*        a block of memory at least 16 bytes long.
* History: Original code by William H. Roetzheim, 1990
