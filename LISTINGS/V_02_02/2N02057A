    TESTPFHT.C  -  Microsoft C ver 5.1

    A driver used to validate the assembly language
    function process_handles_free().

    From the command line, executing this program
    will print the following line.
         free handles: [15]

    When executed under Microsoft CodeView ver 2.2,
    this program will print the following line
         free handles: [11]
    since CodeView has taken four PFHT entries for
    its own use.

    Further proof of the function can be obtained
    by opening one or more files, calling the
    function to check the free handles, and then
    closing one file at a time.  After each close,
    call the function.  The free handle count will
    increase with each close.

    Commands to produce an executable from the code as
    shown in the listings:
        masm pfht;             (listing 3)
        cl -c testpfht.c       (listing 4)
        link testpfht pfht;
