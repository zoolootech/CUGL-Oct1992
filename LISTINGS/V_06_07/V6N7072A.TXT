/* putchar() and puts() functions for device driver */

/*

SYNOPSIS

     putchar(c);
     puts(s);

     int c;    character to be sent to screen
     char *s;  string to be sent to screen

DESCRIPTION

These functions can be called by a device driver to send output to the screen
through the ROM BIOS, instead of the standard output.  They act very much
like their standard C counterparts, using \n as a line terminator.  However,
puts() does not automatically put a \n at the end of the string.  CAUTION: Do
not include stdio.h; that would cause the wrong version of putchar() to be
compiled.

for complete compatibility with the standard C function,
add the command putchar('\n');
