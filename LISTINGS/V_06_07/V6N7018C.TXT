Table 5 -- What the symbols mean
--------------------------------
cmd - bit 0-4, command code: see table 6.  Bit 4 only set for "scan"
     commands, which are not discussed here.
SK - bit 5, Skip deleted address mark.  This article does not cover
     deleted data.
MFM - bit 6, Double Density (Modified Frequency Modulated).
MT - bit 7, Multi-track.  Really should be 'multi-head'.  Allows a  read
     data or read deleted data to continue at the end of track onto the
     other side of floppy.  Do not use for writing.
DS - bits 0 & 1, Drive select
HDS - bit 2, Head select.
C - Cylinder. A part of the sector ID, corresponding to (but not
     necessarily equal to) the position of the track.
H - Head. A part of the sector ID, corresponding to the (but not
     necessarily equal to) the side of the disk.
R - Record. A part of the sector ID, generally called the sector number. 
     Definitely NOT the same as a CPM record.  May or may not be ordered
     sequentially.
N - Number of bytes code.  Defines sector size: see table 7 for value.
EOT - End of Track.  The last possible sector number on the track.  Can
     be larger than the number of physical sectors.
GPL - Gap Length.  Used by FDC when reading or writing.
FGPL - Format Gap Length.  Used by FDC in formatting.  It is a different
value than the GPL used in read/write.  See Table 7 for value.
DTL - Data Length.  Number of bytes in sector if N == 0.  
SC - Sectors per cluster.  Format uses to know how much to write
D - Data Fill byte for format command.  Initial data written to sectors.
NCN - New Cylinder Number.  This is the position to "SEEK" to.
HUT - bits 0-3, Head Unload time.  IBM XT specs 0xF (240 msec).
SRT - bits 4-7, Step Rate time.  (16-SRT) = # millisecond.  IBM XT specs
     0xC, which XT Tech Ref says is 6 ms track-to-track (I figure it to
     be 4 ms).  
ND - bit 0, Non-DMA mode. I don't recommend this: should remain clear.
HLT - bits 1-7, Head Load Time.  2 ms increments.  XT Tech Ref specs
     0x1.
ST0-ST3 - Status registers ST0, ST1, ST2, and ST3.  See table 8 for
     detail.
PCN - Present Cylinder Number.  Where the FDC thinks the head is after a
     seek or recalibrate.

0x08      Sense interrupt status (MUST be issued immediately after Seek 
               or Recalibrate)
0x09      Write deleted data - not recommended
0x0A      Read ID fields (read ID fields off disk, wherever the head 
               currently is).
0x0B      Invalid
0x0C      Read deleted data - not recommended
0x0D      Format a track (the lowest level format)
0x0E      Invalid

Note:  In the IBM PC, the format is double, 512 bytes.  Despite the
information in this table, nine sectors are put on the disk
successfully.
