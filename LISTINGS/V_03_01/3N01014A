(1) Change CONFIG.SYS to this (assuming \dos is on drive C):
 country=002,,c:\dos\country.sys
 device=c:\dos\display.sys con=(ega,,2)

(2) Change AUTOEXEC.BAT to this:
 nlsfunc
 mode con codepage prepare=((863,850) c:\dos\ega.cpi)
 chcp 850

(3) Reboot.

(4) Create, assemble and execute this program:
;Program:  Given a certain accented character, return the
;          plain equivalent via a code page collating table.
;Author:   P. Gulutzan, Ocelot Computer Services Inc.
;Note:     Requires MS-DOS 3.3 or later.
;          This program was originally prepared with MS-DOS 4.0.
;          One would probably want to do a few things differently
;          with MS-DOS 5.0 or DR-DOS 6.0.

d_cseg     segment byte public 'CODE'
assume     cs:d_cseg

xx         db 6 (0)

start:
;MS-DOS 3.3 function: "Get pointer to collating sequence table"
mov        ax,6506h
mov        bx,-1                ;codepage of interest = default
mov        cx,512               ;length of receiving buffer
mov        di,offset d_cseg:xx  ;doubleword pointer to buffer

mov        es,si
mov        dx,-1                ;country of interest = default
int        21h
;A failure here would probably indicate that CONFIG.SYS
;and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT were not set up properly, in which case:
;no display.
jc         endit                        ;(failure)
;At this point xx has:
;  Byte    The subcode passed in AL for the function call: 06h
;  Dword   The address of the collating sequence table
les        di,es:[di+1]                ;Point to the table
;Now es:di points to the collating sequence table, which has:
;  Word    Number of characters. Will be < 256 if truncated.
;  Byte(s) A lookup table for each character
mov        bx,134               ;= the code for a + degree-sign
mov        dl,es:[bx+di]        ;look it up in the collating table
mov        ah,2                 ;display it
int        21h
endit:
mov        ah,4ch               ;stop
int        21h
d_cseg ends
end start

(5) Observe that the result is the letter "A" (ASCII code 65).
(6) Restore the original CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
