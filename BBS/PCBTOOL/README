A directory listing for each directory on the cdrom is in \bbs\pcb.
These listings are in pcboard format.  

In this directory is a batch file called "all.bat".  This batch file
calls 'dirlst.exe' which outputs the correct format for pcboard's
'dir.lst' master index file.  To use this, edit the "all.bat" file.
You have to put the correct drive and path of the cdrom index file.
This is in 

	<drive letter>:\bbs\pcb

(notice no trailing backslash).  You also need to put in correct
drive and path of the files directory, which is 

<drive letter>:\msdos

If you like, you copy the file descriptions to another drive (such as
a faster hard disk).  You will need to update the dir.lst to reflect
this move.

Make a backup first before you try editing dir.lst this way.  I'm NOT
a pcboard sysop.  Feedback is welcome.
