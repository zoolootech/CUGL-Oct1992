       For Electronic Bulletin Board use, the registration fee depends
       on the capacity of the BBS software installed, such as may be
       seen on the welcome screen or otherwise remotely noted.

       The registration upgrade price on going to a larger capacity is
       just the current new registration price minus the current
       registration price for the smaller system.  Of course, if you
       have made a payment which exceeded the price now specified for
       the size system you had, subtract the amount you actually paid
       from the current new registration price.

       Registration is by First Class U.S. Mail addressed to

       Initial Installation of FWKCS:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       After you download FWKCS117.ZIP, here is how to install the new
       FWKCS system for the first time, starting with version 1.17:

       Before intalling FWKCS for the first time:

           to prevent accidental double_counting of files, go over your
           system carefully and make sure either (easy way) that there is no
           case in which the same physical file is reached by two different
           paths (check all your ASSIGN and SUBST commands), or (this is more
           complicated) that you know of all such cases: if you need to use
           duplicate paths, see Note 1, below;

       then do:

           PKUNZIP FWKCS117.ZIP <enter>

           INSTALL <enter>

       and then follow the instructions on the screen.

               Note 1: if you need to have extra path(s) to the same file(s),
                       then later, when you get to the screen which says
                       "Menu for installation" in the upper left corner, use
                       option 5; when S_SETUP is turned over to you for use,
                       study the screen carefully, and leave out (or exclude)
                       the extra path(s) when you specify what to include in
                       the search.


       To Replace FWKCS Ver. 1.12 Or Later:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Here is how to replace an existing FWKCS system, version 1.12 or
       later, which is in good working order, and which was installed using
       the automatic installation procedures:

           PKUNZIP FWKCS117.ZIP <enter>

           REPLACE <enter>

       and then follow the instructions on the screen.
