As great as it is to be able to weed out duplicate files on a bbs,
there's still the drawback of having to create the initial database,
especially for large file systems.  The growing use of CD-ROMs has
made it clear that being able to create the database a piece at a time
and merge them all together would be a help.  Even better would be
prebuilt databases for the more popular CD-ROMs in use on some bbs's.

Surprise!  ZDCS now offers the capability to do just that.  The new
database merge utility (ZDCSDBMG.ZIP) can be downloaded from the ZDCS
home board, The Hacker Central BBS.  To make it even more useful, we
are collecting prebuilt databases, one per CD-ROM, from users of ZDCS
1.64 and making them available as free downloads from the ZDCS support
conference,  These prebuilt databases may be merged with your existing
ZDCS database in a small fraction of the time it would take to create
them yourself from scratch.

To encourage the creation of these pre-built databases, we are
offering a free ZDCS registration to anyone who uploads a ZDCS
duplicate file database for a CD-ROM not already in our collection.
Give The Hacker Central a call to see which ones are already
completed.  You can even leave us a message in the ZDCS support
conference to discuss "reserving" a CD-ROM for which you are creating
the database.

Just one more reason why ZDCS is *simply* the best zipfile duplicate
checking system.
