                             each download directory, listing the files 
                             available for download for that particular file

        SFFILES  .<x>      - Listing of files available for download from a
                             CD-Rom file area.  <x> represents the number of
                             the file area.                           (DISPLAY)

             The FILENAME must begin at column 1
             The FILESIZE must end at column 21

                           When the SFFILES.BBS displays to a caller who is 
                           using ANSI Color Graphics and a file line is not 
                           colored like the others, but rather uses the 
                           caller's default color, it is because the comma in 
                           the file size is either not located properly or does
                           not exist.  SPITFIRE uses the comma in the file size
                           to determine whether the line is a file listing.

        Command <C> - CD Rom Area
                      The option specifies the file area as a CD Rom Area.  
                      If this is toggled on, then SPITFIRE searches the Display
                      File Path for a SFFILES.<x> for the file listing of this
                      CD Rom Area.  The <x> should correspond with the number 
                      of the file area.  For instance, if file area 15 is a CD
                      Rom Area then it would need to be named SFFILES.15.  
                      SPITFIRE does not include CD Rom Areas in its search for
                      <N>ew files or report on file statistics if the BBS has
                      a CD Rom Area.
