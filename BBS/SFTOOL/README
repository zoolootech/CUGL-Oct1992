A directory listing for each directory on the cdrom is in \bbs\sf.
These listings are in spitfire format.

In this directory is a batch file called "all.bat".  You can use this batch
file to create the same kind of bbs sffiles.<x> listings that are in \bbs\sf,
if you don't like the numbers i used for <x>.  You can also get the directory
names from the all.bat, and match them up with the dirs.txt in the root
directory.  [I didn't understand how this was supposed to work...]
