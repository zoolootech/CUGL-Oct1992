File(s) for Fixed Pattern(s). A full implementation of the UNIX
'fgrep' utility. The algorithm used in this program constructs a
deterministic finite state automation (FSA) for pattern matching from
the sub strings, then uses the FSA to process the text string in one
pass. The time taken to construct the FSA is proportional to the sum
of the lengths of the the sub strings. The number of state transitions
made by the FSA in processing the text string is independent of the
number of sbustrings. [Any:Any C compiler] The '-a' option may not be
consistently supported by various non-Unix operating systems and
compilers. Also, the Unix-specific '-b' option of 'fgrep' is not
supported. Finally, non-Unix operating systems may not accept
lowercase character strings on the command line, although these can be
entered through files.

CUG121.28-SH.C v 2.2 By Steve Blasingame. A 'little shell' command
interpreter. The little shell is designed to provide a 'UNIX-like'
shell for CP/M, replacing the CP/M CCP as the primary user interface.
It provides two convenient mechanisms for chaining commands together:
they may be typed on a single line, separated by commas; or files of
commands called Shell scripts may be executed. The CP/M operating
environment does not lend itself to the use of frequently invoked
commands in the form of executable files. Consequently, the shell has
an extensive array of built-in commands, including: cat, ccp, cd, clr,
echo, exit. [CP/M:BDS v. 1.50] Copyright (c) 1982 Steve Blasinqame.
Requires doglob.h and fcb.h for compile.

CUG121.30-TEL.C v 1.0 By Leor Zolman, Leo Kenen, Cal Thixton, Mike W.
Meyer. Tel - dumb terminal + file xfer. Tel is a considerably modified
version of Telnet v. 2.3, as distributed with v1.46 of the BDS C
compiler. The following features have bean added: multiple files may
be transmitted or received by one command, directories may be listed,
and the quit command hangs up a Hayes Smart modem. To accommodate
these changes, some of the command names have been changed. This
program uses a modem to emulate a dumb terminal. Incoming data may be
buffered in memory and written to disk, data may be transmitted from
disk to the modem, or files may be formally transferred in a checksum
mods with automatic handshaking and buffering. ->CALL.C, TELNET.C,
TL370.C. [CP/M:BDS v. 1.50] Requires local.c and files.c for link. The
checksum file transfer does not follow the XMODEM protocol. Variable
baud rate support is present, but commented out (hardware-specific
coding would be required to implement it). Tel assumes that the CP/M
console is much faster than the modem (e.g. a 1200+ baud console with
a 300 baud modem).

CUG121.34-XD.C v 1.0 By Mike W. Meyer. Xd - hexadecimal dump. Dumps a
file to the console in one or more of three formats: ascii, hex (2
digits/byte) or word (standard 8080 format, assuming low byte first).

CUG121.36-TL370.C v 1.0 By Leor Zolman, Leo Kenen, Ken Lonquest. TL370
- dumb terminal with file xfer. TL370 emulates a dumb terminal.
Incoming data may be buffered in memory and written to disk, data may
be transmitted from disk to the modem, or files may be formally
transferred in a 'checksum' mode with automatic handshaking and
buffering. TL370 is a modified version of Telnet v. 2.3, as
distributed with v1.46 of the BDS C compiler. The modification
consists of the addition of optional XON/XOFF handshaking for file
transmission. ->CALL.C, TEL.C, TELNET.C. [CP/M:BDS v. 1.50] Requires
local.c for link. The checksum file transfer does not follow the
XMODEM protocol. TL370 assumes that the CP/M console is much faster
than the modem (e.g. a 1200+ baud console with a 300 baud modem).

CUG121.40-ML2.C v 1.0 By Scott W. Layson, Stephen M. Kenton. ML2 -
modified L2 linker. A version of Scott Layson's L2 linker which has
been modified to produce MP/M modules. The only usage change is the
addition of the -r flag which will start the specified runtime file at
the specified address, then build the rest of the module after it.

submit file to compile all the .C files and link the output with the
remaining files, using the L2 linker. [CP/M:BDS v. 1.50] Copyright (c)
1981, Mike W. Meyer. The link step uses the L2 linker; prohibiting
access to current L2 overlay stuff (the -m, -org, -ovl flags are
passed to the compiler).

CUG146.11-SMALLC.C v 2.0 By Serge Stepanoff, Ron Cain. Small C
compiler for 6800. A version of Ron Cain's Small-C adapted for the
6800 micro under TSC's FLEX operating system. Initial conversion was
done on a PDP 11 running RSX-11 and the DECUS (public domain) C
compiler with Small C code from DECUS. Ongoing development of this
version is being carried out on a SWTPC 6800 with dual 8 inch floppies
and 32K RAM. [Flex v. 2.1:Small C] The TSC assembler accepts any
length labels but only the first 6 characters are used and saved in
the symbol table. Therefore, if you have either functions or labels of
the type MODULE1 and MODULE2, the assembler will generate a multiply
defined label error. Make sure that the first 6 characters are unique.

CUG150.01-AFT8087.MAC v 1.0 By Jean-Marc Belisle. Adj Real No
Exponent. Converts real numbers from Microsoft(?) BASIC or FORTRAN
format to one compatible with the 8087 numeric coprocessor. [MSDOS:

CUG150.02-BIOS.MAC IBM PC BIOS Interface Macros. Macro calls to each
of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) functions. Advantage of using
these macros is that the call (actually an interrupt) can be made by
name, rather than by number, and the macros will move the specified
parameters to the proper location before invoking the BIOS routine. By
the nature of the BIOS functions, these are very low-level function
calls. Intended for use in assembler language programs or subroutines.
->DOS.MAC. [MSDOS:] IBM PC Technical Reference Manual is needed to
document each macro's purpose and parameters.

CUG150.03-CLINK.ASM By Ray Duncan, Patrick Banchy. Load/Link Graphics
Character Table. Allocates 1Kbyte of space for the table, terminates
while stayinq resident. Subsequent calls will load the first lK bytes
of the specified file into the table, and link the table into the
screen display BIOS routine. Purpose is to define the screen images of
the characters between 0x80 and 0xFF, which IBM left as a user
definable option with the PC color graphics adapter card. ->CLINK.COM.
[MSDOS:] User documentation not included. Limited error checking.

CUG150.04-ROFF1.C v 5.1 By M. S. Zachmann. ROFF - " RUNOFFS " Text
Formatter Program. A Text formatter based upon the one in Kernighan
and Plauger's book SOFTWARE TOOLS. Contains provisions for right
justification, page headings and footings, variable margins,
indentation, page numbers in header text, centered text, underlining,
and page lengths. Processes plain ASCII text from almost any editor,
and formats it to drive most printers in straightforward fashion. No
provisions for fancy fonts, proportional spacing, etc. DOC file
contains good but brief tutorial; sufficient for most semi-experienced
users. ->ROFF.DOC, ROFF.H, ROFF.HE, ROFF2.C, ROFF.EXE, CUG103, CUG145,

which call each of the (published) operating system functions of MSDOS
Releases 1.0 and 2.0. The advantage of using these macros is that the
call can be symbolic and the macros will move the parameters to the
correct reqisters before the call. The 1.0 calls have brief
documentation; the 2.0 calls have no documentation. ->BIOS.MAC.

functions of MSDOS 2.x. Routines for CREATE/OPEN/CLOSE/
READ/WRITE/FIND/FSIZE/DELETE of files using path names. Although there
may be some good interfacing information buried here, the need for
these subroutines was ended when Lattice upgraded their C library to

CUG167.12-FGREP.C v 1.05 By Ian Ashdown. Search File(s) for fixed
Pattern(s). A full implementation of the UNIX 'fgrep' utility. The
algorithm used in this program constructs a deterministic finite state
automaton (FSA) for pattern matching from the sub strings, then uses
the FSA to process the text string in one pass. The time taken to
construct the FSA is proportional to the sum of the lengths of the
substrings. The number of state transitions made by the FSA in
processing the text string is independent of the number of substrings.
->FGREP.DOC. Vanilla] The '-s' option may not be consistently
supported by various non-UNIX operating systems and compilers. Also,
the UNIX-specific '-b' option of 'fgrep' is not supported. Finally,
non-UNlX operating systems may not accept lower case character strings
on the command line, although these can be entered through files.

MICRO EMACS v3.9 EXE & DOC
By Daniel M. Lawrence, David G. Con Roy. [public] 1 disk. MicroEMACS
is a micro implementation of the EMACS editor. Source code is on
CUG198, documentation and executable on CUG197. MicroEMACS allows
several files to be edited at the same time. The screen can be split
into different windows, and text may be moved freely from one window
to the next. Depending on the type of file being edited, MicroEMACS
can change how it behaves to make editing simple. Editing standard
text files, program files and wordprocessing documents are all
possible at the same time. For complex repetitive tasks, editing
macros can be written. Special features are also available to perform
a diverse set of operations such as file encryption, automatic backup
file generation, entabbing and detabbing lines, executing DOS commands
and filtering text through other programs (e.g. SORT to allow sorting
text). MicroEMACS can be used with Micro SPELL (CUG248) to create a
system that scans through a file, displaying each questionable word as
part of an edit screen.
