 --Beware of e very close to 1!-- 
Initial eccentric anom           =      280.0000000000000000 
Input mean anom                  =      286.8792980000000000 
Input maximum its                =      15 
Input stop tolerance             =        0.0000010000000000 
Input eccentricity               =        0.1000000000000000 
Final eccentric anom             =      281.2600076068777000 
Mean anom computed from solution =      286.8792979999999000
