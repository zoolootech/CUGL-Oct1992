NOTES:

These two functions are low level primitives for quick screen output in
text modes on IBM PCs and compatibles.  They both detect the screen mode
and video hardware in use on every call.  They are small and fast and
written so that the obj. modules can be linked to memory models small
through huge.

Memrite outputs strings with color attribute to the screen vertically or
horizontally.  Litebar outputs only color attributes in either direction.
These are handy for simple menus and help screens when you don't want the
overhead of a screen driver library in your program.

I would appreciate feedback on any bugs such as snow on Cga screens.
I used the recommended techniques for snow avoidance but I don't have a
Cga to test the program on.  These were debugged on an STB Ega card and
PACKARD BELL Ega monitor combination.
