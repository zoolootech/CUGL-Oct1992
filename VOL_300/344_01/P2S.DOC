Program: 
*		 		P2S
*
*		 printf() to streams i/o converter
*
* Description:
*
* Converts printf() calls to << operators
* Uses Lex to find printf's, fprintf's and sprintf's in C source
* and then uses p2s() call to convert the printf arguments to C++ streams
* formatted I/O.
* Does handle things like %6.2f (width and precision flags)
* by generating the appropriate streams manipulators - setw()
* and setprecision().
* Does NOT handle things like %-6.2f (yet) since there are no manipulators
* for left and right justification (if you decide to enhance this to
* handle this or anything else please submit back to CUG or me)
*
* stdin reads inoriginal C source, converted source goes to stdout.
*
* Usage: 
*
* P2S < {.c file with printfs} > {file with streams i/o}
* Options:
*	f - don't convert fprintf()'s
*	p - don't convert printf()'s
*	s - don't convert sprintf()'s
*	i - converts by doing 
*		#ifdef __cplusplus
*		  ... streams code ..
*		#else
*		  ... old printf code ...
*		#endif
*	    to maintain backward compatibility with C (if desired)
*
* Example:
*
* For example to only convert fprintf calls and maintain C compatibility
* the invocation is:
*
* 	p2s p s i < foo.c >foo.cpp
*	 	
*	
* Construction:
*
* Just flex (or lex) this file, and compile the resultant C source. 
* MKP2S.BAT shows how to make program with Flex and Turbo C.
