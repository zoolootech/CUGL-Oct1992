the

an
implementation

the

inventors
of

in
the
height-balanced
tree
or

is
an
improvement
on
the
traditional
binary

not
to
be
confused
with
b-trees
as
items
are
inserted
into
the
traditional

the

of
the

degrade
into
something
resembling
a

that

suffers

january
issue
for
an
example
of
avl
trees
with
traditional
binary
trees
and
avl
trees
it
is
not
efficient
to
move
from
any
given
node
to
its
successor
or
predecessor
to
find
the
successor
of
a
given
node
in
a
binary
or
avl
tree
you
must
walk
through
the
entire
tree
in-order
until
you
arrive
at
the
node
whose
successor
you
wish
to
find
then
the
next
in-order
node
is
the
desired
successor
finding
the
predecessor
is
done
similarly
threaded
binary
trees
solve
this
problem
by
replacing
the
nil
links
in
leaf
&
half-leaf
nodes
with
links
to
the
node
s
inorder
successor
or
predecessor
or
both
threads
are
distinguished
from
links
with
an
additional
bit
field
in
each
node
one
bit
for
each
child
ptr
with
this
additional
information
the
procedure
for
moving
to
a
successor
node
becomes
simple
and
does
not
require
