This 68020 Assembler V1.0 is an upgrade of the 68000 Assembler written by 
Paul McKee of North Carolina State University in 1986, and released to the 
public domain by Marwan Shaban.
    The author of this upgrade has added the 68020 specific mnemonics (but
excluding the Mathematics Coprocessor mnemonics), and also introduced some 
modifications to make the Assembler a little more to his liking.
    The following modifications should perhaps be mentioned specifically:

        - The 68000 Assembler was compiled using Microsoft C Compiler, while
          the 68020 Assembler has been compiled using Zortech C Compiler
          version 3. This necessitated some minor changes in the source code, 
          only one of which is worth mentioning: the Zortech compiler does
          not require the malloc.h header, needed by the Microsoft C 
          Compiler,

        - The source has been modified to conform to the ANSI C Standard.

    The MAKEFILE provided has been used with Zortech MAKE.
    The assembly source files provided have been used for assembler testing.
The 0TEST.BAT file is provided to automatize the testing.
    While the authorship of the 68020 Assembler must be shared between the 
authors of the original version of the 68000 Assembler and the author of this
upgrade, the blame for any errors in the upgrade falls on the latter.
    This upgrade is released to the public domain, without any guarantee 
as to its suitability for any purpose, or even that it will work at all.
