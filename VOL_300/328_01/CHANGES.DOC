version 1.2 - released 6/31/91 -
	BEGINNING with this version, not tested for Microsoft C.
	ALSO, beginning with next version, all additions will be C++ specific.	
		
	ADDED:	
			   	support for VROOM style overlays. 
						see twmakey.bat and windows.doc	
				whplj_dump () - FAST laserjet printer driver or dump to file
				whplj_install() - tie printer dump to a hotkey. 
				w_ega_color() - returns non-zero if ega is attached to color mon
								returns OFF (zero) if ega attached to mono 
				wfmatr_... data items for control of WFORM display.
				wpulldown_enable  - turns menu system off temporarily.
				wval_date() - validate a text-form date
							(added due to inacurracies in Micrososft C mktime)												
				wputfl () - fixed length string put to screen.
			MOUSE ROUTINES:
				wmouse_move_pixel() - fine control of mouse in graphics mode
				wmsdrag() - mouse draggable windows. see demoform.c
				wmouse_flush () - flush mouse buffer, wait for key release
				wmspopup() - set a function to execute on mouse center key 
				wpopfkey() - key trap routine to pop up fkey menu from mouse.
				
	CHANGED:	
				window.h renamed to wtwg.h (avoid conflict with BORLAND C++)
				wgets() behavior flags, (numerics only), extra parameter added		 
				wscanform () - return value, field attributes, other.		
	QUIET CHANGES:
				wt2showt() now uses localtime() instead of gmtime().
							your program should call tzset() at startup. 	
				wfscanform() - now more flexible about single punctuation mark
								ocurring in stopcode or input file line.
	FIXED:		wbutton_draw() in large model didn't fill with spaces correctly
					garbage shows onscreen when replacing button text with NULL
					(shows up in wpicklist() routine for some large lists)
				wscanform() in large model...
							used wrong form width for some very wide forms.	 			
							misbehaves with BACKTAB key (large model only).	
				wscanform() - screen display for char fields longer than 1 byte.
							other peculiar quirks.
				wfvdate() - no longer depends on mktime() function,
							(MSC gave wrong results for some years)
				wfprintform() senses whether file is TEXT or BIN, adds \r. 2
				wbury() in wabandon.c - fixed loop if window wbury'd too often.
				winit() monitor detection for older ega color systems.
				wmalloc() - slightly more efficient at error messages,
							insignificant change.
				wpulldown() - OK to disable all choices in a menu 2
								(previously, this caused a loop)
				wrelocate() - memory allocation error.
				wbuttont()  - bug related to AT keyboard.

	REMOVED:
				global data item wdoing_form.
				
	QUIRKS:		WFORM tables: warning about position of labels in form table 
					do not make the first or last item a pure label. 		
					behavoir is unpredictable. This is not a 
					serious limitation, just place the labels in 
					the middle of the form (WFORM table doesn't 
					have to be in ascending screen order).
	
	

version 1.1 - 9/10/90 - 
	ADDED: 	wdvinit() - DeskView compatibility TESTED ON 386 version only.
			wsetpalette/wgetpalette - EGA/VGA palette manipulation
			w50line    - VGA 50 line mode, also EGA 43 lines (EGA untested)
			wcurscanln - global variable, set size of cursor (TEXT MODE)
			wmouse_move- move mouse to desired spot 
			whotkey		- simplified creating hotkeys. (see	demohkey.c)
			whome_dir   - 'home' directory
			wrealloc	- similar to wmalloc, for the ANSI- realloc() func.
			wSysRq      - trap the SysRq key (ALT-print screen on IBM AT)
			w_inDOS     - utility for interrupt routines to see if in DOS.
	CHANGED:
			window.h - added __cplusplus extern "C" for TurboC++
						removed a few C++ keywords, also for TurboC++
			mktime() - moved to its own module
						(so if you have TurboC++ you can use Turbo version)
						(just use tlib LIBNAME -wmktime to remove my version)
						
	QUIET CHANGES:
			wmouse.c - changed behavoir of CENTER and RIGHT buttons
								(wmouse_location() now reacts to RIGHT_RLS)
								(WMS_MOVED flag only set for left button down)
			wmalloc  - in large model, now maps wmalloc to wfarmalloc()
						(IE: YOU MUST RECOMPILE LARGE MODEL PROGRAMS)
			wgetc() & other keyboard read routines - low level access,
						MICROSOFT can now use the enhance keyboard.
	FIXED:
			heapdbg.c originally wouldn't compile and link properly
				NOW will compile and link.		
			pulldown menu, improved line rotation logic
				NOW shows selected line prior to calling function.
			winit/wgetmon() - corrected autodetection logic for older EGA's.
			wgets() - no longer shows garbage onscreen if...
							original string 0 or 1 bytes long AND
					  		user presses CTRL-O for original string
							AND then deletes the first byte of original 
							(ie: rare, but annoying...) 					
	REMOVED:	none.
	QUIRKS:
