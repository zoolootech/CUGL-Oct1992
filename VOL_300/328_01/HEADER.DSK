HEADER:		description of 'WTWG' windows system;
TITLE:		routines to Window Text mode or Window Graphics mode 
VERSION:	1.1 released 9/10/90; source released 12/12/90.

KEYWORDS:	windows, keyboard, mouse, text, graphics, expanded memory, menus;

SYSTEM:		MS-DOS v3.0, probably works with v2.0 but untested;
COMPILERS:	Turbo C v2.0, Microsoft C v5.1

DESCRIPTION:	C routines to provide a window-oriented user interface

			1) all the usual 'window dressing' -
				boxes, overlapping windows, mouse-selectable buttons, 
				scrollbars, save/restore screen, etc
				
			2) operates identically in either text or graphics modes
			
			3) transparent integration of mouse and keyboard
				(ie: the mouse is just another key)
				- 2- or 3-button mouse.
				- eliminates hassles with key code/scan code for special keys
				- automatically uses enhanced keyboard (Microsoft or Turbo C)
				- detects ALT-SysRq key on AT keyboards (TurboC only)
				
			4) virtual memory system uses expanded memory, ram, or disk space
			
			5) pulldown and popup menus
				-activated by hotkey or mouse
				-multipage scrolling menus.
				
			6) context-sensitive help
			
			7) programmer-definable 'Hot Keys'
			
			8) keyboard macros - record and playback keystrokes, save to file
			
			9) onscreen clock in either text or graphics mode (Turbo C)
			
			10) simple mouse-driven drawing (TurboC graphics only) 
			
			11) screen-saver = 	
				-blackout after waiting >3min for either key or mouse input
				-in text or graphics, EGA/VGA/HERCULES modes
			
			12) data-entry forms 
				-completely flexible data validation (may define new data types)
				-date, time, etc
				-popup lists of allowable choices for a form item

			13) special video modes: 43/50 line on EGA/VGA, 
				multiple video pages on HERC, EGA, VGA either text or graph.
					

FILENAMES:	window.h = header file describes library routines
			demo*.c  = demo programs (in order of complexity):
						demomous.c - how to use mouse and keyboard
						demomenu.c - pulldown menus & context-sensitive help 
						demoform.c - data entry forms
						demopage.c - multiple video pages 
						demohkey.c - create 'hotkeys'
						demomacr.c - keyboard macros 
						demoheap.c - memory (heap) management routines
									
			*.doc 	  = documentation files
						window.doc  - more detailed introduction to concepts, 
									  covers main features briefly,
									  instructions for installation
									      and use of routines
									  compiler-specific suggestions
						defines.doc - documentation of struct, typedef, #defines etc
						funcs.doc   - documentation of specific function calls.
						changes.doc - update notices
							
			demo*.prj = TurboC .prj files for the demos, same as above.
						NOTE: These are version 2.0 project files.
								If you have TurboC++ use PRJCNVT.EXE
								
			demo*.hlp = text  files for on-line help for the demos
			demo*.hx  = index files for on-line help for the demos.
						created by makehx.exe using demo*.hlp as input
			*.lib     = object libraries
						wgs.lib = Turbo C small model
						wts.lib = Turbo C small model with grapics removed
								  (text-mode only programs)
						wgl.lib = Turbo C large model
						mwgm.lib= Microsoft C (or Quick C) medium model
			makehx.exe = utility for on-line help 
						 (makes help index files .HX from help text .HLP files)
			txt2mcr.exe= utility for keyboard macros
						 (converts ASCII text file to keyboard macro file)
			dir2bat.com= utility for manipulating files
						 (a filter to use with DOS 'dir' command)
			m*.bat     = batch files for microsoft C version
						 mwmake.bat = recompile, make alterations to library
						 mnewmake.bat = make library from scratch
						 mdemo.bat    = make demo programs.
						 mblank.bat   = bat file contains just one blank line
						 				(used by other batch files) 
			T*.bat     = batch files for Turbo C version
						 Twmake.bat = recompile, make alterations to library
						 tdemo.bat    = make demo programs.
			heapdbg.c  = a stripped-down version of the virtual memory program
						 useful for debugging your programs
						 
			----------------------------------------------------------------
			The source disks include: 
						
			w*.c	 	= complete source code for the library, 
							100% 'C' no assembly.
			makehx.c,	= source for utility programs
			txt2mcr.c,
			dir2bat.c			
			wsys.h		= special header used by these library routines
			wscreen.h	= special header used for low-level screen access
			whelp.h		= special header used for help routines.
			msc.h		= Microsoft/Turbo C compatibility header
			
						 
WARNINGS:	IF YOU RECOMPILE THE SOURCE CODE:
			
			TurboC - compile with 'use register' ON and stack frame OFF	
					 or the atexit() functions won't work in large models.
					 
			Microsoft C - MUST define a symbol to specify model used
						  (ie __SMALL__    __MEDIUM__   __LARGE__   etc)
						  set /J switch (default char = signed, ANSI standard)
						  
			see window.doc for more details.
