          Congratulations.  You have successful obtained a copy of the
          shareware version of the RMAXTask multitasking library for C
          and C++.  You should now have the following files:

          README.TXT    - This file

          REGISTER.TXT  - A form for registering your copy of RMAXTask.
                          Upon registration, you will receive full
                          source code to the library, LIB files for all
                          memory models for both C and C++, and a
                          license allowing unrestricted use of RMAXTask
                          in your programs.

          RMAXTASK.DOC  - Complete documentation for the library.

          TASKBCL.LIB   - The library itself, ready to link with C
                          programs compiled for the Large memory
                          segmentation model using a Borland compiler.

          RMAXTASK.H    - A header file to accompany TASKBCL.LIB

          CALLDEMO.C    - Source code which demonstrates proper use of
                          the functions within the RMAXTask library.

          CALLDEMO.EXE  - Compiled version of CALLDEMO.C

          TEST?.C       - A collection of short test programs that will
                          provide additional examples of RMAXTask
                          function calls.


          To get started, we suggest that you skim through the
          documentation and then run the sample programs as you look at
          the source code.  Then you can begin to write your own
          programs, either from scratch or by modifying and enhancing
          the provided sample programs.  Remember that you MUST compile
          using the Large memory segmentation model in order to link
          with the TASKBCL.LIB file.
