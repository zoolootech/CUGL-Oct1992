A short history introduction

        This software is born from the need to assign a symbolic name to
the 64 colors of the EGA color card. In TurboC (tm by Borland International)
only the 16 colors of a standard CGA palette are given symbols
which are : EGA_BLACK, EGA_BLUE... and so on.

        Calling the other colors is quite easy by their codes but giving
a name to every color was pretty hard, I had to give standard names
as EGA_LIGHT/DARK/PALE... to stay in the line given by the graphics library
shipped with the TurboC package.

        I sent a copy of the new color chart to Borland maybe this modest
contribution of mine will help choosing colors when designing a graphic
application willing to be nicer to the eye.


The actual package is shipped with two utilities :

     EDIPAL  .*  (.c & .EXE)
     OUT     .*  (.c & .EXE)

The exe works fine on any EGA or EGA compatible board though I only tested
it on a LEGA-enhanced card.

EDIPAL.EXE is the palette editor : with it you can change as you like the
palette and save it. It lacks the possibility of a permanent save, by this
I mean that I had to trick to save the changed palette by not closing
the graphics system at exit time, so I had at last my DOS commands scrolling
in bright orange and my prompt in a nice EGA_LIGHTPISTACHIOGREEN.

If you don't save the new palette, of course the standard one will be restored.

The problem is that any application that does graphics initialization results
in erasing the new set palette.

The out.exe is a little utility I needed to draw two colums of numbers with
an explicit header eather on disk or on printer so I could write (by hand)
the new color chart (coding such a trivial program would have been killing
mosquitos with a cannon)

By the time you read this there should be a SETPAL utility which reads
a palette file and sets the graphics palette according to this file.

One last word about out.exe it tries to create the "printcol.dat" file
in a directory named c:\tc\garbage which is my actual bucket directory
for tcs' outputs.

This soft is also available At C users Journal Directory of shareware
and public domain.

This software is just the first step I made, some enhancements are planned
and should be ready by the time you read this : saving the palette to a disk
file, a set of small utilities are planned to read and run palettes files
saved with edipal main program.
