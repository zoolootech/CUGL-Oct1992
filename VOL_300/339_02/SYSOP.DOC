     details.  This restriction does not affect your permission to place

     ARCHIVING

          You can use any good quality archiving software to compress the
     CTRLCLIB software before uploading to your BBS.  We strongly recommend
     PKZIP from PKware,  especially since portions of the CTRLCLIB package
     including the User's Guide were compressed using PKZIP and PKSFX from
     PKware.

     LONG FORM:

     CTRLCLIB Ver. 1.0 - Interrupt Management Library (ASP)

          CTRLCLIB - The Ctrl+C Library, contains C-language functions that
     programmers can use to manage user-initiated interrupts.  Using
     functions from CTRLCLIB, programmers can have full control over the
     following kinds of user-initiated interrupts:  All types of program
     "breaks" - control-c, control-break, control-2, and alt-3; the "pause"
     keys - control-s, and 'pause' (or control-numlock); the print screen
     keys - print-screen, control-p, and control-printscreen,  and others.
     There are functions to trap the system reset keys, and/or force either
     a warm or cold reboot.  There are also functions to capture and
     control the setting of all 'lock' keys such as caps-lock and num-lock.
     Facilities exist for capturing keyboard make/break codes if needed.
     Popular C-compilers are supported.  Registration includes the latest
     version with FULL SOURCE CODE and technical support.  $30.00.
