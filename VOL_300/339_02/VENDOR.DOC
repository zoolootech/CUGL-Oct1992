                         CTRLCLIB - The Ctrl+C Library

             A C-Function Library for Interrupt Management Control

     CTRLCLIB contains C-language functions that system designers, software
     developers, and programmers can use to help their PC programs manage
     the user-initiated class of interrupts such as control-C, control-
     break, system reset, an others.  User-initiated interrupts are
     software/hardware interrupts that are generated when PC users press
     unique keystroke combinations while running application programs under
     MS-DOS.

     With functions from CTRLCLIB libraries, programmers can gain control
     over and program for, the following kinds of interrupts:  All types of
     user-initiated program "breaks" - control-c, control-break, control-2,
     and alt-3; the "pause" keys - control-s, and 'pause' (or control-
     numlock); the print screen keys - print-screen, control-p, and
     control-printscreen,  and others. The program can trap the system
     reset keys, and/or force either a warm or cold reboot.  There are
     functions to capture and control the setting of all 'lock' keys such
     as caps lock and num lock.  Programs can examine keyboard make/break
     codes as they are typed by the user.

     What we are doing with CTRLCLIB is attempting to "pull it all
     together" and create a standard programming support library of easy-
     to-use callable C-functions to trap critical keypresses that cause
     program interrupts and unexpected program termination.  CTRLCLIB is
     the result of a long-term effort to create an integrated set of
     interrupt management functions written entirely in C, and callable
     from any program.  No assembly language knowledge or MASM compilers
     are needed.  Our goal is to make CTRLCLIB the definitive MS-DOS
     standard for managing user-initiated program interrupts.

     The Shareware version of CTRLCLIB will contain libraries for both the
     small and large memory model for popular C-compilers.  The registered
     version will contain FULL SOURCE code and libraries for two additional
     memory models, medium and compact.
