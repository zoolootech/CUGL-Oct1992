THRESHVIEW COMMANDS 

ESC     Exit from Threshview mode. 
<BS>    Interrupt screen re-draw. 
V <CR>  Show cluster values.
L <CR>  Log new drive or subdirectory. 
G <CR>  Enter Grid mode. 
W <CR>  Write a disk file of the picture presently on the screen. This is 
        NOT the same as ^W in the main commands. 
A <CR>  Enter Auto-draw mode.
R <CR>  Re-draw the screen.
M <CR>  Mask shift.
? <CR>  Help. 

In place of a top or bottom value for a cluster:
C  Clear the present cluster.
M  This stands for the current value of maxit.
<  This stands for one less than the current value of maxit.
=  Sets the top and bottom equal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO-DRAW COMMANDS

C  (At the "Start?" prompt.) Clear all the clusters in the specified range.

<CR>  At the "First cluster?" prompt, <CR> means cluster 0, the lowest 
cluster. At the "Last cluster" prompt, <CR> means the highest cluster, which 
is cluster 300 on the present version of Emandel. At the "Start value", 
"size", or "gap" prompt, <CR> means 1. At the "Stop?" prompt, <CR> will set 
stop = maxit-1. 

ESC  Abort auto-draw.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

ESC  Exit from Grid mode.
<space bar>  Erase prompt line.
+  Increment step size 1.
*  Increment step size by ten.
-  (Minus sign)  Decrement step size by one.
<BS>  Set step size to 1.
<Del> Toggle glide/step.

5       Stop.
<Home>  Moves the cross-hairs upward and to the left.
<UA>    Moves the cross-hairs upward.
<PgUp>  Moves the cross-hairs upward and to the right.
<LA>    Moves the cross-hairs to the left.
<RA>    Moves the cross-hairs to the right.
<End>   Moves the cross-hairs downward and to the left.
<DA>    Moves the cross-hairs downward.
<PgDn>  Moves the cross-hairs downward and to the right.

^B  Open/enlarge a box.
^S  Shrink a box.

^R  This moves the right-hand side of the box right by one step.
0   (zero, not the letter oh)  This closes the box.
#   Batch file for present grid box.
^J  Batch file for Ejulia using present cross-hair point as the Julia point.
