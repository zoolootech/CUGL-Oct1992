                 EnQue Offers FREE Programming Tools for C

   EnQue Software has released a major upgrade of its UltraWin text
windowing library.  Key features of UltraWin 2.10 are unlimited overlapping
windows, background printing, PC timer control, mouse and graphic support,
and enhanced data entry capabilities.  Also included are a hypertext help
engine and an EGA/VGA font editor.

   Also released is InTUItion 1.10, a textual user-interface library that
includes an interface construction program that allows UltraWin users to
interactively create dialog boxes, menus, pick lists, forms and more using
a mouse.  Source code can be automatically generated to perform processing
on each item, saving hours of tedious hand coding and debugging.

   The UltraWin and InTUItion tools and small model libraries are available
FREE from most major online services, the EnQue BBS, or by sending $2.00 for
shipping and handling to EnQue Software.  Complete source code, large model
libraries and printed manual can be obtained from EnQue for $39.95 for
UltraWin and $99.95 for both UltraWin and InTUItion.  Free upgrades and
technical support are available through the EnQue BBS.

   Requires either Microsoft C or Quick C, Turbo C/C++ or Borland C/C++.
