+                          Executing a Panels Program


    While a panel is active, during the execution of a panels program, the
 following keys are used for data input:

      <Right Tab>     Moves cursor to the next unprotected screen field.

      <Left Tab>      Moves cursor to the previous unprotected screen field.

      <Home>          Moves cursor to the first unprotected screen field.

      <Ins>           Toggles insert mode on and off.  The cursor is a little
                      larger when insert mode is on.

      <Del>           Deletes the character under the cursor.

      <End>           Erase to end of field.

      <Arrows>        Moves the cursor in the appropriate direction,
                      possibly into a protected area.  A click will be heard,
                      if attempting to enter data into a protected area.

      <Func keys>, <Page Up>, <Page Down> and <Esc>  When one of these keys
                      is pressed execution returns to the application program.
                      These response keys are the default, any keystroke can
                      be configured as a response key by the application
                      programmer.
