+                              TEXT FILE FORMAT

    A panel text file begins with an optional size statement followed by an
 optional background statement.  One or more tag statements are used to relate
 field attributes and field names to special characters or symbols.  After the
 tag statements is the actual screen layout, which must begin with a tagged
 symbol.

+      size <ul_row> <ul_col> <lr_row> <lr_col>
+      background <color>
+      tag <symbol> <attributes> <variable>...<variable>
+         .
+         .
+         .
+      <symbol> ........................................

+         .
+                              SIZE STATEMENT

    This is an optional panel statement, and if present must precede the
 background statement or the first tag statement.  This statement simply
 sets the size of the window in which the panel will be constructed.

    Format:
+              size <ul_row> <ul_col> <lr_row> <lr_col>

    where:
               <ul_row> is the upper left row of the window
               <ul_col> is the upper left column of the window
               <lr_row> is the lower right row of the window
               <lr_col> is the lower right column of the window

    Example:
               size 0 0 13 39   Defines a panel to be 14 rows by 40 columns
                                located in the upper left part of the screen.


 If a size statement is not present within a panel definition, the default
 window coordinates are 0,0 and 24,79.  If a panel is defined to be smaller
 than the previous active panel, the previous panel will be partially visible
 behind the new panel.  However, the overlaid panel will not be active again
 until the new panel is destroyed (i.e. no I/O functions may be performed on
 the previous panel).














+                           BACKGROUND STATEMENT

    This is an optional panel statement, and if present must precede the first
 tag statment.  This statement simply sets the screen background color when
 a CGA adapter is in use.  If a monochrome adapter is in use the background
 statement is ignored.

    Format:
+                background <color>

       where <color> is a digit 0 - 7

    Color codes:  0 = Black (Default)
                  1 = Blue
                  2 = Green
                  3 = Cyan
                  4 = Red
                  5 = Magenta
                  6 = Brown
                  7 = White
+                              TAG STATEMENT

    A tag statement allows you to relate a special character or symbol with
 a field definition.  This definition includes the field attributes as well
 as the field names.

    Format:
+                tag <symbol> <attributes> <variable list>

    <Attributes>:   P = Protected, U = Unprotected
                    H = High Intensity, L = Low Intensity
                    B = Blink
                    R = Reverse
                    _ = Underline
                    D = Dark
                    0    \
                    1     \
                    .      Foreground Color Code
                    .     /    (as defined for background)
                    7    /
    Some attributes may have no effect with certain monitor types (i.e. the
 color codes will have no effect using a monochrome display adapter).


    <variable list>:  one or more field names separated by at least
           one blank.  Valid names are no more than eight characters
           begining with a letter.  No special characters are allowed.

    Each variable or field name is matched to a field on the screen layout.
 If more fields are defined with the tag symbol than variables in the list,
 the last variable name in the list is used to name the remaining fields.
 In this case, a subscript other than 1 is used to access like named
 fields.







+                                EXAMPLES


+   tag % p
+   tag & uh field
+   %         Example 1
+
+         Name:&               %
+
+         Addr:&               %


    In this example, there are two unprotected fields.  The first field would
    be accessed using the name  FIELD  subscripted by 1, and the second would
    be called  FIELD  with a subscript of 2.

    experiment with entering some actual data.

    The screen background color is defined to be blue.  The ! symbol defines
    protected red fields.  The @ symbol defines protected, reverse fields with
    white characters.  The asterisk tagged field is named  SELECT  and
    will be unprotected, underlined and green.

    The screen background color is defined to be white.  The ! symbol defines
    protected red fields.  This example demonstrates the use of the size
    statement.  The panel is defined as a 7 x 27 character box to be displayed
    in the lower right part of the screen.

+                              PANEL DESIGN


    Try your hand at designing your own panel!  Use any word processor to
    create the panel file.  Be sure your file has an extension of PAN.

    Optionally, you may use IPD to create and modify a panel, type:

+                            ipd [<fn>]

    After your panel text file has been created, type:

+                            showpan <fn>

    where <fn> is your panel file name without the .PAN extension.
