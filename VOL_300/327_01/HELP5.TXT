+                        COMPILATION AND LINKAGE


    Included in the Panels for C package is one or more of the following
    object files:

          SPANELR.OBJ   - MicroSoft C DOS small memory model
          LPANELR.OBJ   - MicroSoft C DOS large memory model
          SPANELP.OBJ   - MicroSoft C OS/2 small memory model
          LPANELP.OBJ   - MicroSoft C OS/2 large memory model
          SPANELTC.OBJ  - Turbo C DOS small memory model
          LPANELTC.OBJ  - Turbo C DOS large memory model


+                             MicroSoft C

    Assuming you have written a DOS program to be compiled with MicroSoft C,
    you could use one of the following commands to compile and link it with
    the Panel routines:

+                cl /F 2000 YourPgm.c spanelr.obj         Small model

+                cl /AL /F 2000 YourPgm.c lpanelr.obj     Large model

    The /F option sets the size of the program stack for the executable
    file.  This must be set to an adequate value.  A makefile is also
    included in the package illustrating how panel programs are built.


+                               Turbo C

    Using the Turbo C integrated development environment, create a project
    file with your source file name and either SPANELTC.OBJ or LPANELTC.OBJ
    listed in it.  Select the make EXE option from the compile menu.


    For other compilers, consult your reference manual.
    Be sure to include the file PANEL.H and KEYS.H in your source code.
