This is my initial release of ROFF5, v2.00 for MS-DOS:
.P
It suppercedes ROFF4, v1.61 and v1.62 which have previously been
placed in the public domain.  This new formatter has evolved to
follow more closely the naming conventions of the UNIX[R by AT&T]
text formatting programs, nroff and troff.
.P
There are considerable differences in that it supports the use of
longer register and macro names, supports a large variety of
inexpensive output devices, and provide the user with the ability to
generate custom characters (such as Greek symbols for mathematics). 
.P
This formatter is not intended to replace a WYSIWYG word processor
which is more convenient for short notes, etc.  This formatter is
great for longer reports where one wants to follow a particular
style, such as doing all the paragraphs the same way, using
numbering of each section, etc.
.P
I look forward to receiving comments, concerns, bug reports, etc.
To minimize confusion this distribution is "ROFF5, version 2.00".
