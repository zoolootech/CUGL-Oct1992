        ROFF4,  v1.60  is  being provided essentially in the
public domain, not because it isn't good, but to  provide  a
means   to  create  and  transport  technical  documentation
between users  with  different  hardware.    This   is   not
possible  with  commercial formatters because they are often
not powerful enough to handle  special  symbols,  equations,
and the  like.    Equally  importantly,  there  is  not much
standardization and commercial formatters cannot  be  "given
away";   the  sender  and  receiver are not as likely to own
the same commercial formatters.

        I am a practicing scientist and  I  need  to  format
manuscripts  which  are  sometimes  long, contain equations,
special symbols, footnotes, and illustrations.  I  needed  a
formatter  that  was easy to use, flexible, and available to
others.  It takes me less time  to  type  a  manuscript  for
this  formatter and rework it, including special characters,
than to have it typed and retyped by a typist only  to  have
me proof read it ad nauseum.

        ROFF4 is  table  driven;    it is relatively easy to
configure for different output devices.    I  have  used  it
with the  MX-80  and  Graftrax  printer  combination;  It is
able to create special symbols where needed.    I  Also  can
get  special symbols on my CRT screen because of my computer
hardware   (the   Exidy   Sorcerer   has   user    definable
characters).   However, the characteristics of my CRT device
and of my printer are very different.  My design  philosophy
was  to be able to drive either from the same input files so
that I could "preview" my output before going  to  hardcopy.
You may  have  a  variety  of  output  devices;    use  your
imagination.

        Your comments, criticisms, and possible bug  reports
will be most useful.

        I  hope  to  extend ROFF4 so that it will be able to
better utilize  specialty  printers  (it  presently  assumes
that  the  printer  does  NOT  know  how  to  backspace, nor
reverse scroll).  I  will  have  to  learn  how  to  support
printers that do proportional spacing and variable pitch.

        I  would  also  like  to  write  a  translater  that
automatically   converts   WORDSTAR(tm   MicroPro)    files,
including  control-P  and  dot commands into input files for
ROFF4.  ROFF4 ignores the parity bit on  input  files.    It
may  get confused by inputting control-codes (it should only
get the <CR><LF> and <TAB> of standard CP/M text files).
