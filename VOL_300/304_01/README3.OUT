     This is my initial release of ROFF5, v2.00 for MS-DOS:

     It  suppercedes ROFF4, v1.61 and v1.62 which have previously
been placed in the public domain.  This new formatter has evolved
to follow more closely the naming conventions of  the  UNIX[R  by
AT&T] text formatting programs, nroff and troff.

     There  are  considerable differences in that it supports the
use of longer register and macro names, supports a large  variety
of  inexpensive  output  devices,  and  provide the user with the
ability to generate custom characters (such as Greek symbols  for
mathematics).

     This  formatter  is  not  intended to replace a WYSIWYG word
processor which is more convenient for short notes,  etc.    This
formatter is great for longer reports where one wants to follow a
particular  style, such as doing all the paragraphs the same way,
using numbering of each section, etc.

     I look forward to receiving comments, concerns, bug reports,
etc.  To minimize confusion this distribution is "ROFF5,  version
2.00".
