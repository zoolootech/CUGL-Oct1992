This is some further comments about ROFF4, v1.62 for MS-DOS:

This version is identical to the files submitted into the public
domain in September, 1984 except for this file and the inclusion of
the file, WSROFF4.PAS.

The version of ROFF4 v1.61 for the CP/M-80 operating system has been
in the public domain for a considerable length of time and I have
used it regulary in that environment.  It appears to be free of bugs
(it does not disagree in its behavior with my intentions nor with
the documentation).  The MS-DOS version has not been excercised by
me until recently, as I am now using MS-DOS regularly.

One bug that I have found in the MS-DOS version, but I can work
around, is: If the software needs to send to the output a control-Z,
the MS-DOS operating system will treat it as an end-of-file and
close the output stream!  One should avoid printer requests that use
this character!

To drive the printer one can use the redirection: "}prn".  Do NOT
use the ">" symbol for redirection because MS-DOS will perform the
redirection instead of ROFF4.  When ROFF4 does the redirection it
will provide a running commentary to the console while the "real
output" will be redirected.  If one uses MS-DOS, the commentary will
be redirected!

A common "bug report" I have received but is just as was designed is
that the .rm command will not take values larger than the currently
set "output width" (set by .ow).  Thus, if you want to set margins
at, say, 10 and 70, you should first extend the output width:

	.ow 70
	.in 10
	.rm 70

A lot has happened since I developed ROFF4 version 1.61.  I am in
the process of doing a major revision.  Since this is being done in
my "spare time", it be ready about mid-1989.  I am regularly using
MS-DOS now instead of CP/M.  The C compiler that will be used is
Turbo C, version 2.0, which is tracking the ANSI C proposed
standard.  I hope and expect that the standardization of C will
reduce the difficulties that I have experienced in porting C source
code in the past.  As I do not have the DeSmet C compiler, I am not
tempted to just continue with these C files.

I am using as "models" for the revision WordStar(TM) version 5.0 and
nroff and troff.  The user interface is often better with WS and the
powerful macro capability is better in the UNIX(R) formatters.  It is a
delicate matter what to name the various dot commands.  The command,
".rm" in WordStar sets the right margin but in nroff "removes" a
definition.  I expect that I shall end up with changing the names of
some of the commands in the next version (ROFF4, version 2).  In all
probability I shall settle on mostly a subset of the nroff command names
but with the "nifty" command, ".rr" from the recent versions of WS
which make a "picture" of the line layout and the specialized
commands I developed to define characteristics of printers.  I shall
maintain the use of longer names (identifiers) used in definitions
then the mere 2 symbols allowed in nroff and troff.  Anyway, time
will tell.

I look forward to receiving comments, concerns, bug reports, etc.
To minimize confusion and to take into account that this diskette
contains this recent documentation and the WSROFF4.PAS file, this
distribution is "ROFF4, version 1.62"
