Welcome to this demonstration program ^
                                      ^
In the following frames, I will show  ^
features of most of the routines in   ^
the Library.                          ^
                                      ^
These routines are specifically for   ^
VGA hardware, allowing developers to  ^
incoroporate these features without   ^
overhead of supporting older boards.  ^
                                      ^
This Library also offers much more    ^
capabilities than that which comes    ^
with high level language compilers.   ^
                                      ^
Specifically :-                       ^
