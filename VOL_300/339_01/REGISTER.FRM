     and it  is not  in  the  public  domain.    It  is  distributed  as
     Shareware, which means that before you pay for the package, you may
     try it  and see  if you  want to  continue using  it.   You may use
     CTRLCLIB free for a trial period of up to thirty (30) days.  If you

     though you  are still  free to  keep copies  and pass them along to
     others.

          You may  use your  registered copy  of CTRLCLIB  on  a  single
     computer.   You may  also install  it on  a computer  attached to a
     network, or  remove it  from one  computer  and  install  it  on  a
     different one,  provided there is no possibility that a single copy
     of CTRLCLIB  will be  used on  more than  one computer  at a  time.
     Network,  site,  and  Right-To-Copy  licenses  are  available  from
     Trendtech Corporation.   You  may  NOT  give,  sell,  or  otherwise
     transfer copies  or portions  of the registered version of CTRLCLIB
     any other person or business for any reason.  You may copy CTRLCLIB
     for backup  purposes, and  you may  give copies of the unregistered
     (Shareware) version  to other  individuals, which they may also use
     and copy under the terms of this agreement.

          You may  NOT distribute CTRLCLIB other than through individual
     copies of the unregistered version passed to friends and associates
     for their individual use.  Specifically, you may not place CTRLCLIB
     or any part of the CTRLCLIB package in any user group or commercial

     Corporation, and  you may  not distribute  for a fee, or in any way
     sell copies of CTRLCLIB or any part of the CTRLCLIB package.

          Like all useful computer software, CTRLCLIB may contain errors
     in the program or documentation.  If you find such an error, or are
     otherwise dissatisfied with the registered version of CTRLCLIB, you
     may return  the  entire  package  within  thirty  (30)  days  after
     purchase for  a full refund of your original registration fee. Such
     a refund  shall be  your sole  remedy  for  any  program  error(s).
     Trendtech Corporation  shall not  be liable  for  any  other  costs
     incurred by you due to such errors.

          If you  do not  agree with  the terms  and conditions  of this
     license, you  do not  have permission  from Trendtech  Corp. to use
     CTRLCLIB, and  you must  stop using  it and  remove  it  from  your
     computer.   Any use or distribution of CTRLCLIB which violates this
