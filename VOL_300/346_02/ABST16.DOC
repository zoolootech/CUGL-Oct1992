           The AS6816 Cross Assembler for the 68HC16 16-bit microproces-
        sor is a new member of the ASxxxx Cross Assemblers.  

           The assembler and linker have been tested using DECUS C under
        TSX+ and RT-11, PDOS C V5.4b, and with TurboC V1.5 under MS/DOS.
        Source  code for the machine dependent portion of the AS6816 as-
        sembler and documentation for the assembler and  linker  is  in-
        cluded  with  the distribution.  Additionally, test code for the
        AS6816 assembler is included.
