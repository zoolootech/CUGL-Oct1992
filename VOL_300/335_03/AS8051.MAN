     NAME
          as8051 - cross assembler for microcomputers

     SYNOPSIS
          as8051 [-p cpu] [-l listfile] [-o hexfile] [-d] [-s
          symbolfile] input

     DESCRIPTION
          The as8051 command assembles the input file into a text
          output file representing the program memory for a
          microcomputer.

          Options

          -p cpu
               Ignored by this program.

          -l listfile
               Output a file formated with the memory address, data,
               and source input lines.

          -o hexfile
               Output the memory data image in a form accepted by most
               prom programmers.

          -h hexfile
               Same as -o.

          -d   Save the intermediate data file (see FILE) and abort
               the execution at the end of processing.

          -s symbolfile
               Print the symbol table values and names, one per line
               in the specified file.
