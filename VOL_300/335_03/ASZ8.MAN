     NAME
          asz8 - cross assemblers for microcomputers

     SYNOPSIS
          asz8 [-p cpu] [-l listfile] [-o hexfile] [-d] [-s symbolfile] input

     DESCRIPTION
          The asz8 command assembles the input file into a text output
          file representing the program memory for a microcomputer.

          Options

          -p cpu
               Override the instruction set selection.
                    Valid Values for Cpu
                         z8600, z8, Z8, UPC, upc, Z8090

          -l listfile
               Output a file formated with the memory address, data,
               and source input lines.

          -o hexfile
               Output the memory data image in a form accepted by most
               prom programmers.

          -h hexfile
               Same as -o.

          -d   Save the intermediate data file (see FILE) and abort
               the execution at the end of processing.

          -s symbolfile
               Print the symbol table values and names, one per line
               in the specified file.

     FILES
          /usr/tmp/frtXXXXXX

     NOTES
          There is only one input file.

          The program can select which subset of instructions is
          accepted.  The program first uses the name with which it is
          invoked.  This is scanned for a substring which indicates
          which set to use.  The -p options overrides this selction by
          performing the same substring search.  Finally the input
          file can select which subset to use with the CPU statement.

          There should only be one executable file with all of its
          names linked to it.
