                    ========================================
        
        'XCXREF'  is  a  cross-reference  utility for 'C' programs.  It 
        is derived from another program named  'XC' developed as indicat-
        ed below.
        
             Option flags support the following features:
        
             - Routing of list output to any combination of disk, printer 
               and video.
             - Cross-referencing of reserved words.
             - Processing of nested include files.
             - Proper processing of nested comments.
             - Generation of program listing only.
             - Variable output page width.
             - Indirect and direct file name input.
             - Alternate path direction.
        
               Usage: xcxref <filename> ...  <flag(s)>
        
        All files selected are cross-referenced together. The variable 
        listing will show every occurance, for  example, of 'var' in 
        every file.
        
              Flags: -e            = Write program data to log file.
                     -g            = Ignore missing files.
                     -i            = Enable #include processing.
                     -l            = Generate listing only - no xref.
                     -o <outfile>  = Write output to named file.
                     -p            = Write output to line printer LPT1.
                     -r            = Cross-reference 'C' reserved words.
                     -s            = Write output to video screen.
                     -w width      = Width of output page; default = 78
                                                           max     = 150.
             Flags MUST FOLLOW all input file names.
        
             Separate any flag parameters from the flag by at least
             one space.
        
               Examples:
        
                 xcxref file1.c
        
                 xcxref main.c file1.c file2.c file3.c -o xref.lst -w 120
        
                 xcxref @xfile file3.c file4.c -o xref.lst -w 120
                    xfile contains...  file1.c file2.c

                  PC Enhancements include:
                   1)  Nested #INCLUDE statements
                   2)  Single spaced cross-reference list
                   3)  Removal of tabbing on output device
                       (Since many printers don't support it)
                   4)  #INCLUDE statements with both "--" and <-->
                       syntax and with a full fileid in the quotes.
                       (Paths are not supported.)
                   5)  Multiple input filenames on command line.
        
               The  current  PC  version only supports Lattice. 
               Conversion to others should be relatively  easy  but  see
               the compile time variable "Lattice" for compiler specific
               sections.

                 The following is a brief summary of the XCXREF changes:
        
                  Converted to IBM/PC Microsoft QuickC.  Program renamed 
                  to 'XCXREF' due to extensive code and functional 
                  changes.
        
                  The source code has been reformatted into a more read-
                  able style, variable names have been changed to a 
                  meaningful word rather than a coded acronym and the 
                  program modified (I  hope)  to conform to the new ANSI 
                  standards.  Additional comments have been added where I 
                  felt they were needed.  Dead code has been removed, 
                  including all conditional compilation code.
        
                 The number of referenced symbols raised to 5000 from 749.
                 Although this is still a memory bounded program for the
                 cross reference data.  I have tested it on an IBM PC/XT, 
                 640KB, CGA, 30MB hard disk.  The largest cross reference 
                 I have tried included 15+ programs consisting of 30,000 
                 lines of code, producing 350+ output pages with 2000+ 
                 referenced symbols.
        
                 The accompanying xc.exe is compiled as a 'compact' 
                 model.  This or any other large data model is necessary
                 to accomodate the increased number of symbol references.
        
              Command line Flags usage:
              -e            = Write program data to log file
                  Key program variable data will be written to a log 
                  file, XCXREF.LOG, in the event of either a recoverable 
                  error condition or abnormal error program exit.  Any 
                  partial cross reference created to the  abnormal exit 
                  is retained.  Upon a successful program completion the 
                  ending values of these program variables will also be 
                  written to the log file.
        
              -g            = Ignore missing files
                  If this flag is not entered any file selected and not 
                  found by the program will cause termination of the 
                  process.  If it is entered the not-found condition will 
                  be ignored, a message will be displayed, and processing 
                  will continue with the next file.
        
              -i            = Enable #include processing
                  If this flag is not entered all #include files will be 
                  ignored, a message will be displayed, and processing 
                  will continue.
        
              -l            = Generate listing only - no xref
                  The program(s) will be listed to the output types 
                  specified.  No cross reference will be created.


              -o <outfile>  = Write output to named file
                  All program output will be written to the named disk 
                  file.  This may be in addition to other types of pro-
                  gram output such as the printer and video screen.  Do 
                  not enclose the file name in the '<>' brackets.
        
              -p            = Write output to line printer LPT1
                  The -p command line flag will direct the program and 
                  crossreference listing to the line printer, LPT1.  This 
                  is in addition to any other directed output.  Printing 
                  is accomplished by direct calls to the operating system 
                  BIOS.  This has the (undesirable ?) side effect of 
                  tying this version to PCs using MS/PC-DOS.
        
                  It is suggested that when using this option that you 
                  set '-w 132' on the command line and set your printer 
                  to condensed, 17.5 CPI, print mode.  The program in-
                  serts two index numbers at the beginning of each print 
                  line.  These and long coded lines may cause the print 
                  lines to be 'folded' making the listing difficult to 
                  read.
        
              -r            = Cross-reference 'C' reserved words
                  'C' reserved words are normally ignored.  This option 
                  will cause them to be treated as normal variables and 
                  they will be included in the cross reference.
        
              -s            = Write output to video screen
                  The -s command line flag will direct the program and 
                  crossreference listing to the video screen.  This is in 
                  addition to any other directed output.  Display is 
                  accomplished by direct calls to the operating system 
                  BIOS.  This has the (undesirable ?) side effect of 
                  tying this version to PCs using MS/PC-DOS.
        
              -w width      = Width of output page; default = 78
                                                    max     = 150
                  This option defines the width of a 'page' output line.  
                  This is used for all three output media.
        
              Command line Program name usage:
                  The programs to be cross referenced may be entered on 
                  the command line with the option flags or in an indi-
                  rect reference list file or a combination of these two 
                  methods.
        
                  If the first character of a file name on the command 
                  line is an @ it is a reference to an ASCII file con-
                  taining a list of file names.  The program when it 
                  encounters this will then get the program names, and 
                  any additional paths from that file.  On file EOF 
                  XCXREF will return to the command line.
        
                  NOTE: The first character of any file name in a list 
                        file CANNOT be an @.

        
                  A sample @file is included with this package.
        
                  In addition, the indirect file may contain up to four 
                  alternate path designations for use in locating pro-
                  grams entered.  
        
                  Each is expected as '#qpathn <dr:\path\path\>', the 'n' 
                  may be 1 - 4.  There must be a space before the '<' and 
                  the actual path must be enclosed in the "<>" brackets.  
                  These may be anywhere in the file.  They will become 
                  effective when encountered.
        
                  Qpaths may only be entered via the indirect list file, 
                  they cannot be entered on the command line.  Once 
                  entered the path will be retained unless cleared or 
                  reentered.  
                  To clear an alternate path enter as #qpathn <>.
        
                  Program names are expected to be without any path 
                  designation.  They are normally expected to be in the 
                  default logged directory.  If a program is not found 
                  there then the four alternate paths, if any, are tried 
                  in sequence.  If the program is still not found it is 
                  processed according to the -g option flag.
        
                  If a fully qualified program name is entered it will 
                  override the the use of the default and alternate 
                  paths.  If it is not found these other paths will NOT 
                  be tried.
