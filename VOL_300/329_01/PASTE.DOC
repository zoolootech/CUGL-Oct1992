     NAME
          paste - merge same lines of several files or subsequent
          lines of one file

     SYNOPSIS
          paste file1 file2 ...
          paste -dlist file1 file2 ...
          paste -s [-d]list file1 file2 ...

     DESCRIPTION
          In the first two forms, paste concatenates corresponding
          lines of the given input files file1, file2, etc.  It treats
          each file as a column or columns of a table and pastes them
          together horizontally (parallel merging).  If you will, it
          is the counterpart of cat(1) which concatenates vertically,
          i.e., one file after the other. In the last form above,
          paste replaces the function of an older command with the
          same name by combining subsequent lines of the input file
          (serial merging).  In all cases, lines are glued together
          with the tab character, or with characters from an
          optionally specified list.  Output is to the standard
          output, so it can be used as the start of a pipe, or as a
          filter, if - is used in place of a file name.

          The meanings of the options are:

          -d
           Without this option, the new-line characters of each but
           the last file (or last line in case of the -s option) are
           replaced by a tab character.  This option allows replacing
           the tab character by one or more alternate characters (see
           below).

          list
           One or more characters immediately following -d replace the
           default tab as the line concatenation character.  The list
           is used circularly, i.e., when exhausted, it is reused.  In
           parallel merging (i.e., no -s option) the lines from the
           last file are always terminated with a new-line character,
           not from the list.  The list may contain the special escape
           sequences: \n (new-line), \t (tab), \\ (backslash), and \0
           (empty string, not a null character.)  Quoting may be
           necessary, if characters have special meaning to the shell
           (e.g., to get one backslash, use -_d"\\\\").  SPECIAL NOTE:
           This version of paste has had the list of special
           characters expanded from the Unix(Tm) standard to include
           the following additional characters: \b (backspace), \f
           (form-feed), \r (carriage return), \v (vertical tab).

          -s
           Merge subsequent lines rather than one from each input
           file.  Use tab for concatenation, unless a list is

           specified with -d option.  Regardless of the list, the very
           last character of the file is forced to be a new-line.

          -
           May be used in place of any file name, to read a line from
           the standard input. (There is no prompting).

     EXAMPLES
          ls | paste -d
            list directory in one column

          ls | paste - - - -
            list directory in four columns

     DIAGNOSTICS
          no delimiters
            Missing list for -d option

          <filename> : cannot open
            paste was given a bad filename

          too many files
            Except for -s option, no more than 12 input files may be
            specified.

     CAVEATS
          This program is a complete rewrite of the Bell Laboratories
          command of the same name; no part of the original source or
          manual is included.  Therefore, you may feel free to use it,
          and its source, without violation of any contract
          agreements.  However, I retain the copyright in order to
          specify it remain available for use by all and sundry,
          without cost.  Feel free to modify as necessary, although I
          went to great pains to recreate the behavior of the original
          command; I would suggest this congruence be maintained.

          Along the same lines, although I've made a reasonable effort
          to test the more arcane behavior of the original paste and
          reproduce it, there are no guarantees; and there are four
          known differences between the original program and
          documentation, and this version.  All are downward
          compatible.  First, paste as distributed with Unix has a bug
          in the way it handles multiple files for the -s option.
          This has been fixed, and the bug reported to the providers
          of the Unix command.  Secondly, the list of valid escape
          characters for the list has been expanded.  Third, the 511
          character/line restriction has been removed.  Finally,
          extant undocumented diagnostics have been added to the man
          page, and the one pertaining to the (now obsolete) line too

          I remain in no way liable for any loss, either explicit or
          incidental, that may be incurred through use of this
          command.  I do ask that any bugs (and, hopefully, fixes) be
          reported back to me as encountered. - David M. Ihnat,
