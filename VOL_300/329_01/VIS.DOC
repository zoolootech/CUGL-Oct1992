VIS

Purpose
visual display of files

Syntax
vis [-et] [file...]

Comments
Vis displays the contents of the specified files, or of standard input
if no files are specified or when the special filename "-" is
encountered.  Non-printable characters are made visible by displaying
them in the following format.  For characters with a value of greater
than 127 (i.e.  the high bit is set; these are known as metacharacters),
the string "M-" is displayed followed by the character with a value of
128 less (i.e.  with the high bit reset).  For characters with values of
less than 32 (control characters), except for newline and tab (see
below), the character '^' is displayed followed by the character with a
value of 64 more (i.e.  '@' or a capital letter).  The DEL character
(value of 127) is displayed as "^?".  For characters in the range
128-157 (control characters with the high bit set), both "M-" and "^"
will be displayed. 

Options
-e	show the ends of lines as '$'
-t	don't treat tabs specially; show them as '^I'
