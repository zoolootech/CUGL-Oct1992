               Flags are single characters preceeded by '-':
               -c      Only a count of matching lines is printed
               -f      Suppress printing filename before matching lines
               -n      Each line is preceeded by its line number
               -v      Only print non-matching lines
               

          DESCRIPTION              DESCRIPTION  

               This  is a MS-DOS version of the Unix egrep(1) command,
               using Henry  Spencer's  regular  expression  functions.
               Most  of  the rest of this documentation is copied from
               the manual page for regexp(3).  

          REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX              REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX  

               A  regular  expression  is  zero  or   more   branches,
               separated by `|'.  It matches anything that matches one 
               of the branches.  

               A branch  is  zero  or  more  pieces, concatenated.  It
               matches a match for the first, followed by a match  for
               the second, etc.  

               A  piece  is  an atom possibly followed by `*', `+', or
               `?'.  An atom followed by `*' matches a sequence  of  0
               or more  matches  of the atom.  An atom followed by `+'
               matches a sequence of 1 or more matches  of  the  atom.
               An atom followed by `?' matches a match of the atom, or 
               the null string.  

               An   atom   is  a  regular  expression  in  parentheses
               (matching a match for the regular expression), a  range
               (see  below),  `.' (matching any single character), `^'
               (matching the null string at the beginning of the input 
               string), `$' (matching the null string at  the  end  of
               the input string), a `\' followed by a single character 
               (matching  that  character), or a single character with
               no other significance (matching that character).  

               A range is a sequence of characters enclosed  in  `[]'.
               It  normally  matches  any  single  character  from the
               sequence.  If the sequence begins with `^', it  matches
               any   single   character  not  from  the  rest  of  the
               sequence.   If  two  characters  in  the  sequence  are
               separated  by  `-', this is shorthand for the full list
               of ASCII characters between them (e.g. `[0-9]'  matches
               any decimal  digit).    To include a literal `]' in the
               sequence, make it  the  first  character  (following  a
               possible `^').    To include a literal `-', make it the

          HISTORY              HISTORY  

               The regular expression functions were posted to  Usenet
               by  Henry  Spencer  of  University of Toronto. The main
               program comes from the  DECUS  grep  with  its  pattern
               matching ripped out.  

               The  program  was  compiled  using Microsoft C 4.0, and
               linked so that ambiguous filenames are expanded.  

               This release was put together by Kent Williams.
