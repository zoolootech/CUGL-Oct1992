     NAME
	  cut -	cut out	selected fields	of each	line of	a file

     SYNOPSIS
	  cut -clist [file1 file2 ...]
	  cut -flist [-d char] [-s] [file1 file2 ...]

     DESCRIPTION
	  Use cut to cut out columns from a table or fields from each
	  line of a file; in data base parlance, it implements the
	  projection of	a relation.  The fields	as specified by	list
	  can be fixed length, i.e., character positions as on a
	  punched card (-c option), or the length can vary from	line
	  to line and be marked	with a field delimiter character like
	  tab (-f option).  Cut	can be used as a filter; if no files
	  are given, the standard input	is used.

	  The meanings of the options are:

	  list
	   A comma-separated list of integer field numbers (in
	   increasing order), with optional - to indicate ranges as in
	   the -o option of nroff/troff	for page ranges; e.g., 1,4,5;
	   1-3,8; -5,10	(short for 1-5,10P); or	3- (short for third
	   through last	field).

	  -clist
	   The list following -c (no space) specifies character
	   positions (e.g., -c1-72 would pass the first	72 characters
	   of each line).

	  -flist
	   The list following -f is a list of fields assumed to	be
	   separated in	the file by a delimiter	character (see -d);
	   e.g., -f1,7 copies the first	and seventh field only.	 Lines
	   with	no field delimiters will be passed through intact
	   (useful for table subheadings), unless -s is	specified.

	  -dchar
	   The character following -d is the field delimiter (-f
	   option only).  Default is tab.  Space or other characters
	   with	special	meaning	to the shell must be quoted.

	  -s
	   Supresses lines with	no delimiter characters	in case	of -f
	   option.  Unless specified, lines with no delimiters will be
	   passed through untouched.

	  Either the -c	or -f option must be specified.

     HINTS
	  Use grep(1) to make horizontal "cuts"	(by context) through a

     CUT(1)			 UNIX 4.0			CUT(1)



	  file or paste(1) to put files	together column-wise (i.e.,
	  horizontally).  To reorder columns in	a table, use cut and
	  paste.

     EXAMPLESS
	  cut -d: -f1,5	/etc/passwd
	    mapping of user IDs	to names

	  name=`who am i | cut -f1 -d:`
	    to set name	to current login name

     DIAGNOSTICS
	  line too long
	    A line can have no more than 511 characters	or fields.

	  bad list for c/f option
	    Missing -c or -f option or incorrectly specified list.  No
	    error occurs if a line has fewer fields than the list
	    calls for.

	  no fields
	    The	list is	empty.

     CAVEATS
	  This program is a complete rewrite of	the Bell Laboratories
	  command of the same name; no part of the original source or
	  manual is included.  Therefore, you may feel free to use it,
	  and its source, without violation of any contract
	  agreements.  However,	I retain the copyright in order	to
	  specify it remain available for use by all and sundry,
	  without cost.	 Feel free to modify as	necessary, although I
	  went to great	pains to recreate the behavior of the original
	  command; I would suggest this	congruence be maintained.

	  Along	the same lines,	although I've made a reasonable	effort
	  to test the more arcane behavior of the original cut and
	  reproduce it,	there are no guarantees.  I remain in no way
	  liable for any loss, either explicit or incidental, that may
	  be incurred through use of this command.  I do ask that any
	  bugs (and, hopefully,	fixes) be reported back	to me as
	  encountered. - David M. Ihnat, ihuxx!ignatz
