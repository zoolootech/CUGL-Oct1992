TITLE:          dprintf -- Source Code;
VERSION:        August 30  1989;
DESCRIPTION:    "dprintf is a clone of the printf function, as defined in the
                ANSI standard. Presented in source code, the programmer can
                modify and adapt it as needs dictate -- dprintf is highly
                portable and expandable.
KEYWORDS:       printf, output, library functions;
FILENAME:       DPRINTF.C;
WARNINGS:       "The floating point output formats cast doubles to ints: on
                some systems, too long floating point numbers may fail to
                convert, or otherwise result in inaccurate figures.

                Permission is hereby granted to freely distribute dprintf,
                provided that no commercial use is made of it whatsoever."
