     NAME
          as8048, as8041, as80c50  - cross assemblers for
          microcomputers

     SYNOPSIS
          as8048 [-p cpu] [-l listfile] [-o hexfile] [-d] [-s symbolfile] input
          as8041 [-p cpu] [-l listfile] [-o hexfile] [-d] [-s symbolfile] input
          etc.

     DESCRIPTION
          The as8048, as8041 commands assemble the input file into a
          text output file representing the program memory for a
          microcomputer.

          Options

          -p cpu
               Override the instruction set selection.
                    Valid Values for Cpu
                         80C48 80c48 80C35 80c35 80C49 80c49 80C39
                         80c39 80C50 80c50 80C40 80c40 8048 8035 8049
                         8039 8050 8040 8041 8042

          -l listfile
               Output a file formated with the memory address, data,
               and source input lines.

          -o hexfile
               Output the memory data image in a form accepted by most
               prom programmers.

          -h hexfile
               Same as -o.

          -d   Save the intermediate data file (see FILE) and abort
               the execution at the end of processing.

          -s symbolfile
               Print the symbol table values and names, one per line
               in the specified file.

     FILES
          /usr/tmp/frtXXXXXX

     NOTES
          There is only one input file.

          The program can select which subset of instructions is

          accepted.  The program first uses the name with which it is
          invoked.  This is scanned for a substring which indicates
          which set to use.  The -p options overrides this selction by
          performing the same substring search.  Finally the input
          file can select which subset to use with the CPU statement.

          There should only be one executable file with all of its
          names linked to it.
