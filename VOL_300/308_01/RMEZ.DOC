The files RMEZGOTO.C and RMEZLOOP.C are translations into the C
language of the classic Parks McClellan Remez FIR filter design
program.

The translations are based on the FORTRAN program as listed in
the 1975 Prentice Hall book "Theory and Application of Digital
Signal Processing" by Rabiner & Gold.  The file RMEZGOTO.C is a
direct, almost line for line translation including 47 goto
statements; RMEZLOOP.C substitutes "while()" loops where
appropriate, reducing the number of gotos to 5.

The program has been modified to output the file IMPULSE.RMZ in
lieu of punched cards.

Compiles with Borland Turbo C vers 2.0 command "tcc rmezloop.c"
or with Microsoft Quick C vers 2.00 commands "qcl rmezloop.c /c"
and "link rmezloop.obj /STACK:0x2000".

The file PAD.C reads a commandline-specified file and writes the
file PADDED.DAT containing the commandline number of data
points.  Adds "0.0"s if needed to create sufficient points.
Useful for zero padding short impulse response sequences so that
a long FFT can be used to obtain good frequency resolution.
Usage:    pad filename #points.
Example:  pad impulse.rmz 512.

The file COEFF.C estimates the required number of filter
coefficients and is based on the formula on p. 156 of the book by
Rabiner & Gold.  It has been written to specify passband ripple
in dB instead of in percent deviation.

These translations are released to the public domain.
