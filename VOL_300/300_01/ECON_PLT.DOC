PURPOSE:  This program provides Z_chart plots of any data that is 
appropriately plotted against dates along the abcissa (x-axis). Input 
data is in the form of a table of values to be plotted. The first column 
is the date and a separate plot is provided for each consecutive column 
of values.

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Z-chart is a forcasting tool. Trends 
can be deduced from the shape of the curve. It is a line chart which 
plots three different lines using the same periodic data. A moving 
average total, a cumulative total, and the period data values are all 
plotted on a single chart. The name for the chart arises from the 
rough shape of the three lines plotted. With the number of periods (N) 
along the x-axis, the top line of the 'Z' is the moving average total 
for N periods. The diagonal line of the 'Z' is the cumulative total 
for the last N periods of the data set, and the bottom line of the 'Z' 
is formed by plotting a the actual per period data values. Note that 
the last moving average total value plotted and the last cumulative 
value plotted have the same value so that both lines meet at the upper 
right corner of the 'Z'. 

The upper line is the long term trend and indicates a rise if the line is 
hooking upward, the diagonal line shape (upward hooking suggests a rising 
trend) indicates the short term trend, and the bottom line can be 
examined to cyclic variations.

To generate a 'Z' chart, the user prepares an ASCII text containing all 
of the data to be plotted. Comments may be embedded in the textfile as 
long as they are enclosed in curly braces. The dates are in the form, 
yymmdd (year month date), so they can be easily sorted into date 
sequence prior to plotting using the MSDOS sort function. The  dates 
are placed in the first column, and each suceeding column contains the 
the data for each 'Z' chart to be plotted. A column title is placed 
above each column. The column title appears on the Z-chart when it is 
plotted. 


Here is an example input file named <INPUT.INP>

USER INTERFACE DESCRIPTION:  The program is executed by entering 
"ECON_PLT". The user is then prompted for the file name of the input data 
file. The file nane where the data is stored (i.e. INPUT.INP) is then 
entered. The program will then prompt the user for the number of periods 
to be summed for the moving average total and for the cumulative 
totals. Next the 'Z' chart for the first column of data is plotted on 
the screen labeled with the column heading. If graphics.com was run 
befor the ECON_PLT was run you can print a hard copy of the chart using 
the shift-print screen key on Epson compatible graphics printers. The 
next and each suceeding column of data can be viewed by striking the 
space bar. After the last column of data is plotted the program exits to 
the operating system. 


A. INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION: The ASCII file to be read by CONTOUR.EXE can 
be typed up using a separate text editor. The file must be arranged as 
follows:


Data                                                             
Line No. Data line description                                                       
-------- ------------------------------------------------------------

1        The first line is a series of column headings for each column. 
         The first column heading should be "DATE".

2        Each suceeding row begins with a date in the yymmdd form and 
.. to .. then each sucessive column contains the periodic value 
  last   corresponding to the column where it appears. The rows must
   row   be in date sequence.


NOTE: Lines containing only comments or which are blank
      are not counted.                                 


PROGRAM LIMITATIONS:  This program is not universally applicable to all 
situations encountered. The x-axis is labeled with only by the year and 
the year is in scientific notation. Also if the values fluctuate from 
plus to minus the Z-chart can be difficult to interpret. 

The version of the program on the distribution disk require the use of a 
CGA monitor. Object code for Borland's BGI CGA graphics driver is linked 
to the program. 

The C-language source code for the charting package (Quin-Curtis' 
Scientific and Engineering Software written is Turbo C) is used by the 
program but is not included because it is proprietary. I recommend the 
package because of it many capabilities and reasonable price. The C-
language source for the main is provided and it demonstrates how easily 
the dynamic arrays can be interfaced to the third party array handling 
packages. The fact that this program is sizeable and that the source 
code is short illustrates the power available using these two libraries 
together.
