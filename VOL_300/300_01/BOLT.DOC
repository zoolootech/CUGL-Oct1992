PURPOSE:  To demonstrate a simple MAT_LIB application program.  The 
program is very short but that is one of the greatest strengths of 
MAT_LIB. Relatively powerful programs can be written quickly. This 
program is not intended for professional use. Bolt stress is 
calculated by dividing the applied load by the net root area. The 
program should be examinined only as an illustration of how to use the 
MAT_LIB functions. 

REFERENCE:  None.

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The user prepares an ASCII text file 
contaning the bolt loads, bolt diameters, and the number of bolt threads 
per inch. The root area at the base of the threads is computed first and 
then the load is divided by the calculated area to determine the bolt 
stress. The bolt stress and key input parameters are then directed to 
an output file. Comments (such as the column headings) may be included 
in the input textfile as long as they are enclosed in curly braces. 

Here is an example input file named <INPUT.INP>

{
Sample         Tension     Bolt           Threads
Identifier     Load        Diameter       Per
               (lbs)       (in)           Inch
}
A              1000        0.375          16
B              3000        0.500          13
C              5000        0.625          11
D              9000        0.750          10


The following file is output:

{
BOLT.OUT  6/1/1989
}
{
                 Sample             Area(sq_in)       Stress(lbs/sq_in) 
}
                      A                  0.0496              20180.3613 
                      B                  0.1214              24710.9141 
                      C                  0.2182              22912.2207 
                      D                  0.3444              26135.6309 



USER INTERFACE DESCRIPTION:  After creating the input file "BOLT.INP, the 
program is executed by entering "BOLT". The program will execute, 
calculate the bolt stresses, store the results in BOLT.OUT, and exit to 
the operating system.  Notice that if a line of data is added the program 
will automatically evaluate it and include the results in the output 
file. 

A. INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION: The ASCII file to be read by BOLT.EXE can 
be typed up using a separate text editor. The file must be arranged as 
follows:


Data                                                             
Line No.    Data Description                                                     
---------   -------------------------------------------------------------

1           Mark number, tensioin load, bolt diameter, and pitch separated 
.. to ..    by spaces or tabs.
number of
bolts


NOTE: Lines containing only comments or which are blank 
      are not counted.
                                  

PROGRAM LIMITATIONS:  This program is not universally applicable to all 
situations encountered. The input file must be named "BOLT.INP" and the 
output is always directed to the file named "BOLT.OUT". The MAT_LIB 
boundary checking (tck) macro is not used to make sure no calls are made 
outside the dynamic text arrays. It is always a good idea to use it at 
least for debugging.
