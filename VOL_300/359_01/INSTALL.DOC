INSTALLING:

To install, you must do the following:

* Create a directory to install in, like c:\djgpp.

* Copy files from disks to c:\djgpp.

* Merge binary files by running commands:
    C:\DJGPP> merge djgppzip djgpp.zip
    C:\DJGPP> merge patch4 patch4.zip
    C:\DJGPP> merge patch5 patch5.zip	

    After the merge, you may erase djgppzip.000-006, patch4.000-001, 
    and patch5.000-001 for saving disk space

* Create a "temp" directory, like c:\tmp.

* Un-zip djgpp.zip in "djgpp" directory.
    C:\DJGPP> unzip -d djgpp.zip

* Un-zip patch4.zip in "djgpp" directory.
    C:\DJGPP> unzip -d patch4.zip

* Un-zip patch5.zip in "djgpp" directory.
    C:\DJGPP> unzip -d patch5.zip
        
* Add the following lines to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    set GCCBIN=c:\djgpp\bin
                 ^ Use DOS slashes here so that AOUT2EXE.BAT will work
    set GCCINC=c:/djgpp/include
    set GCCLIB=c:/djgpp/lib
    set GCCTMP=c:/tmp
    set GO32TMP=c:/tmp
    set GO32=ansi driver c:/djgpp/drivers/SOMETHING.grd gw 1024 gh 768
                         ^^^ whatever driver works with your VGA (optional)
    set BISON_SIMPLE=c:/djgpp/lib/bison.simple
    set BISON_HAIRY=c:/djgpp/lib/bison.hairy
    set FLEX_SKELETON=c:/djgpp/lib/flex.skeleton

  TMP and TEMP are checked if GCCTMP isn't set
  GO32TMP is where go32 puts its paging file (GCCTMP, TMP, TEMP are checked,
  in that order, also)

  Remember that unless you manually type these at the command line,
  they won't take effect until you reboot.  Don't include the "ansi"
  keyword in the "go32" variable if you don't have an ANSI.SYS driver
  or equivalent.

* Add your binaries directory to your PATH in C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    SET PATH= . . . ;C:\DJGPP\BIN

That's it! G++ is now installed on your system.
