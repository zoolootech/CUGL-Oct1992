I have gotten many many requests to email this or post it, because of
its size email'ing it screws up most mailers, so i am submitting it to
mod.sources to be posted.  Please note a major cavaet with this, it was
written under Unisoft's port of Unix so the a.out file that it uses
more closely resembles the b.out.h file that most cross assemblers
(e.g.  greenhills) use. For the obvious reasons i have not included that
file with the posting. I did not write this nor do i make any claim to
that effect.

This is the 68000 disassembler mentioned on the net.
It is not my final version by any means, but I have found it extremely
useful and it represents several weeks' work.
